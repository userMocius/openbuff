 * Live context-window usage for the status line.

 * semantic-compaction budget for the ACTIVE model (exactly the values
 * `getSemanticCompactionBudget` returns for the resolved context window), so a
 * UI can show at what point compaction will fire instead of surprising the
 * user with it. Both are optional for compatibility with persisted or replayed
 * events emitted before the fields existed, and a consumer that ignores them
 * keeps its previous behavior — no consumer migration is required.
 *
 * RELATION TO `max` — the two are computed from DIFFERENT inputs, so a
 * consumer must NOT assume the trigger sits inside the reported window:
 *   - `max` is the status window: the resolved model context window, clamped
 *     by an explicit `maxContextLength` override when one is configured
 *     (`min(maxContextLength, contextWindow)`), and falling back to the flat
 *     190k default only when neither is known.
 *   - `compactionTriggerTokens`/`compactionTargetTokens` are derived from the
 *     RAW resolved model window alone and are deliberately NOT clamped by
 *     `maxContextLength` (an override does not move the window-derived
 *     trigger), and when that window is unknown they are the conservative
 *     140k/100k fallback budgets rather than anything derived from `max`.
 *
 * So `compactionTriggerTokens > max` is a legitimate, expected payload: an
 * override that shrinks `max` below the model's own trigger, or the
 * unknown-window fallback against a small configured window, both produce it.
 * The ONLY ordering guaranteed between the new fields themselves is
 * `1 <= compactionTargetTokens <= compactionTriggerTokens`. A consumer that
 * renders trigger against `max` (a marker on a usage bar, a percentage, a
 * warning threshold) must therefore clamp or suppress it for itself; the CLI
 * status bar drops the marker entirely once the trigger reaches `max`, since
 * pinning it to 100% would claim compaction fires exactly at the window edge.

/**
 * Live context-compaction progress. ADDITIVE, non-breaking public-contract
 * change: this is a NEW member of the {@link printModeEventSchema}
 * discriminated union — no existing event variant is removed, renamed, or
 * retyped, so no consumer migration or deprecation is required. In particular
 * the terminal {@link printModeContextCompactionSchema} result event keeps its
 * exact shape.
 *
 * PRODUCER CONTRACT. Every `loopAgentSteps` invocation emits this event —
 * the root turn, foreground subagents, and inline agents alike — so every
 * emission is correlated to its own run by the required `runId` /
 * `ancestorRunIds` pair (`agentId` is supplied when the producer knows it, and
 * is rewritten by subagent forwarding — see the CONSUMER CONTRACT below).
 * `state: 'started'` is emitted immediately before a step that is likely to run
 * semantic compaction (the pruner agent runs inline and is hidden from the
 * CLI, so without this the user sees nothing until the result arrives).
 *
 * EMISSION GATE. The only trigger is the window-derived semantic compaction
 * budget being exceeded by the pre-step context estimate. In particular:
 *   - It is NOT gated on the agent having a `handleSteps` generator. An
 *     orchestrator's generator spawns the pruner itself; a prompt-only
 *     template instead gets an equivalent runtime-driven pass, and both
 *     announce through this event. A consumer must therefore expect `started`
 *     from prompt-only agents too.
 *   - It IS suppressed for an iteration the loop's token-state governor
 *     denies (cooldown, rearm-pending, or the per-turn pass cap), and for an
 *     iteration where the transient loop-owned anti-thrash advisory
 *     (`suppressSemanticCompaction` on the agent state) is active. The
 *     advisory keeps its documented streak-based contract: it is set once
 *     two consecutive semantic passes in the turn reclaim no context space
 *     — which also spends the turn's remaining pass budget in the governor
 *     — cleared by a productive pass, and reset to `undefined` at loop
 *     entry. An over-trigger iteration the governor denies is additionally
 *     mirrored into the advisory so the generator-driven inline spawn path
 *     honors the same pacing; below the trigger the advisory is not touched.
 *     The mirror is per-iteration and never sticky: it recomputes the field
 *     from the current governor decision and the streak state, so the
 *     documented clearing paths — a productive pass, and a second announced
 *     pass after the governor re-arms — stay reachable for the inline spawn
 *     path.
 *     A suppressed iteration runs no pass and emits
 *     NEITHER half of the pair — it is not reported as a `started`/`settled`
 *     no-op — so a consumer must not infer "the trigger was never exceeded"
 *     from the absence of an event.
 *   - It is deliberately NOT gated on an explicit `maxContextLength` override,
 *     so an overridden run does not emit a `started` on every step.
 *   - For the runtime-driven (prompt-only) pass, the ordinary spawn-permission
 *     contract still applies AFTER the announcement: a template that does not
 *     declare `context-pruner` in its `spawnableAgents` announces a pass that
 *     then declines to spawn, so an announced pass is not a guarantee that any
 *     compaction happened. The terminal `context_compaction` result remains
 *     the only signal that context was actually reclaimed.
 *
 * `state: 'settled'` is emitted after the compaction branches for every
 * `started` of the SAME `runId`, and again on that run's exit path when a step
 * throws or is cancelled before reaching them, so a pass that decides NOT to
 * compact cannot leave a live state stuck on screen. A run emits at most one
 * unsettled `started` at a time. Both budgets and the pre-step context size are
 * optional because they are informational only.
 *
 * CONSUMER CONTRACT. Pair `started` with `settled` by `runId`: a `settled` from
 * one run never settles another run's `started`, so concurrent or nested loops
 * cannot cross-settle each other. `ancestorRunIds` is empty ONLY for the root
 * agent run (mirroring `printModeReasoningDelta`), so a consumer that renders
 * live compaction state as root-level UI must ignore events whose
 * `ancestorRunIds` is non-empty — otherwise a subagent's compaction shows up as
 * a root-level 'Compacting context…' card. Consumers that nest per-agent UI can
 * instead key off `runId`, which — like `ancestorRunIds` — is forwarded
 * verbatim. `agentId` is NOT a per-agent key: the `spawn_agents` forwarding
 * path overwrites it with the direct child's agent id on every forwarded event
 * that is not text/tool/subagent, so a depth>=2 run's delivered `agentId`
 * identifies the nearest forwarding child rather than the emitter.
 *
 * One case stays unreachable by construction: a user-initiated abort makes the
 * SDK drop every post-abort event, so a consumer that renders `started` as live
 * UI must be able to settle that state on its own — the CLI stamps its pending
 * card with the producing process id and renders a replayed one as an
 * interrupted pass, so a persisted transcript never replays a permanently live
 * card.
 *
 * Forward-compatibility contract for `handleEvent` consumers: an exhaustive
 * `switch`/match over `event.type` should treat unknown variants as no-ops
 * (the SDK's own default handler only branches on `error`, and the CLI handler
 * uses a catch-all `.otherwise`). Consumers that only care about the final
 * compaction result can safely ignore `context_compaction_status` entirely.

 * `switch`/match over `event.type` should treat unknown variants as no-ops
 * (the SDK's own default handler only branches on `error`, and the CLI
 * handler uses a catch-all `.otherwise`). Consumers that do not care about
 * background-job progress can safely ignore `job_update` events entirely.
