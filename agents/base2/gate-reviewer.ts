 *

 * tested ones instead of a second inline read of `result.advisories`.
 *
 * Reviewer-family symmetry: `advisories` is an OPTIONAL additive output field.
 * Only code-reviewer declares it today; a family that omits it (security
 * reviewer, routed specialists) reads back here as no advisories, so no other
 * reviewer schema has to migrate and an older receipt keeps round-tripping.
 *
 * Advisory text is returned verbatim (trimmed only). Delimiter safety lives at
 * the emitter: base2's `formatGateStateBlock` escapes `</` as `<\/` (a legal
 * JSON string escape) before writing the tag-delimited `<gate-state>` block, so
 * an advisory quoting the literal `</gate-state>` cannot truncate that block for

 * attestable fingerprint the receipt already fails closed on the
 * missing-fingerprint blocker, so the coverage union is preserved purely so
 * the diagnostic stays informative. `schemaVersion` is 1 only when EVERY
 * shaped entry reports 1 (otherwise the first non-conforming version, so the
 * caller's `!== 1` check rejects the whole receipt);
 * `collectReviewerAttestationIssues` additionally rejects a result whose
 * shaped entries report distinct attestable fingerprints while NO entry
 * reports the expected one (ambiguous multi-receipt attestation — when the
 * expected fingerprint IS reported, entry-scoping resolves unambiguously and
 * sibling foreign fingerprints are tolerated order-independently).
 *
 * The deletions-only receipt (a single shaped entry with an attestable
 * fingerprint and empty `reviewedFiles`) still attests.
 *
 * With no shaped entry at all the LAST entry is read verbatim, so a receipt that
 * never attested still fails closed on the caller's schemaVersion check.

 * function — is what establishes coverage-completeness (every pending file
 * attested) and verdict agreement across the structured entries. This function
 * inspects only the resolved attestation (the same one
 * `collectReviewerAttestationIssues` reads, via `resolveReviewerAttestation`)
 * and reports any well-formed non-matching v3 value, including one from a
 * receipt with a file-coverage gap, so a caller that skips the attestation
 * guard would report drift for a review that is already hard-blocked. Both
 * base2 gate families guard correctly for reviews that reached attestation:
 * the final code-reviewer gate and the routed specialist gates.
 *
 * CRASH-PATH EXEMPTION: a caller that forces `attestationIssues` to `[]`
 * because `detectReviewerCrash` fired never ran attestation at all, and is
 * exempt from the precondition. A crashed result normally carries no structured
 * entry, so this function returns ''; if one does carry a drifted fingerprint,
 * the resulting record is telemetry-only and credits the review with nothing —
 * the gate still treats it as a crash.
 *
 * `collectReviewerAttestationIssues` deliberately tolerates that drift so an
 * unrelated bundle bump cannot fail the gate; callers use this to RECORD the
 * drift instead of accepting it silently, because a review of stale file
 * content would otherwise pass the gate with no trace. '' means there is
 * nothing to record: an exact match, or a missing/non-attestable fingerprint
