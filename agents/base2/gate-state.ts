/**
 * Gate-issued per-task validation receipt for one EXECUTE_PLAN plan task.
 *
 * This is the evidence `update_plan_status` verifies a `checkpoint.receiptIds`
 * entry against before a PLAN.md task may move to `done`. The runtime's
 * `validatePlanTransition` already refused a `done` transition without a passed
 * validation checkpoint carrying at least one receipt ID, but those IDs were
 * entirely model-supplied, so an invented string satisfied the rule. A receipt
 * here is minted ONLY by base2's own fresh validation/reviewer gate pass, which
 * is what ties task completion to real gate evidence.
 *
 * EVIDENCE KINDS. A plan task whose gate cycle produced no reviewable diff must
 * still be completable, and its receipt must not claim content evidence it does
 * not have, so `evidence` records exactly what the cycle covered:
 *   - `'reviewed-diff'`: the reviewable subset the reviewer attested; `files` is
 *     that subset.
 *   - `'unreviewed-scope'`: pending files existed but NONE of them were
 *     reviewable (docs-only / `.md` / `.agents/`), so the reviewer was skipped.
 *     `files` is the VALIDATED pending set and the receipt claims no content
 *     review. Without this kind the mint produced a receipt whose fingerprint
 *     was the hash of an EMPTY file list — a constant — while presenting as
 *     reviewed-diff evidence.
 *   - `'no-diff'`: the cycle had no pending files at all (work that is pure
 *     verification, or whose only output is a non-reviewable artifact). `files`
 *     is empty, so this fingerprint is a CONSTANT by construction.
 *   - `'committed-surface'`: an OPT-IN reviewer-family review of a fully
 *     committed CLEAN worktree, requested through a successful
 *     `update_plan_status` call carrying `requestCommittedSurfaceReview: true`
 *     while a task is claimed. `files` is a bounded, gate-derived set of the
 *     task's runtime-observed files (each reviewable, each with a verifiable
 *     64-hex sha256 content marker), and every routed reviewer-family
 *     specialist attested the set. Like `'reviewed-diff'` the fingerprint
 *     covers real file bytes, so the receipt survives turn-start content
 *     verification while the covered bytes stay identical.
 *
 * `files` is the gate-covered set this receipt attests — for
 * `'unreviewed-scope'` that is the validated pending set, not a reviewed subset.
 * The invariant that makes verification uniform across all four kinds is
 * `snapshotFingerprint === hashGateSnapshotDetails(buildGateSnapshotDetails(files, ''))`:
 * content only, with an EMPTY summary component. For `'reviewed-diff'` that is
 * exactly the reviewable-set fingerprint base2 computed for the review.
 *
 * Why `receiptId` is GATE-COMPUTED rather than reviewer-reported: it embeds the
 * prefix of the fingerprint base2 hashed itself, the same provenance rule that
 * makes `Base2ReviewReceipt.gateId` trustworthy. A reviewer-REPORTED
 * `snapshotFingerprint` is deliberately drift-tolerated by the attestation path,
 * so deriving the receipt from it would let a reviewer (or a model quoting one)
 * choose its own receipt ID and forge completion evidence. A non-attestable
 * fingerprint (a stable `unreadable:*` marker) is an error string rather than
 * content evidence and never mints a receipt, for any kind.
 *
 * LIFETIME. At most ONE receipt is live per `taskId`: a newly minted receipt
 * REPLACES the task's previous one instead of appending, so the printed ID is
 * unambiguous. Two complementary mechanisms retire a receipt that has stopped
 * being true, keeping the published ledger to receipts that hold right now:
 *   1. Content verification (`prunePlanTaskGateReceipts` in base2.ts, at turn
 *      start and immediately before the mint): recompute
 *      `hashGateSnapshotDetails(buildGateSnapshotDetails(files, ''))` and drop
 *      the receipt unless the recomputation is attestable AND equal to
 *      `snapshotFingerprint`. Structurally invalid entries are dropped too.
 *   2. Change supersession (`supersedePlanTaskGateReceiptsForChangedFiles` in
 *      base2.ts, called from `recordChangedFiles` and from the credited-file
 *      eviction ledger): drop every receipt whose `files` intersect the changed
 *      paths, plus EVERY receipt whose `evidence` is neither `'reviewed-diff'`
 *      nor `'committed-surface'` — those have no verifiable content identity (a
 *      `'no-diff'` fingerprint is a constant and can never fail verification,
 *      and an `'unreviewed-scope'` fingerprint covers a non-reviewable pending
 *      set), so only supersession can retire them. The two verifiable kinds
 *      hash real file bytes: a change to paths they do not cover leaves them
 *      true, and only an intersecting change retires them. Legacy receipts
 *      serialized before `evidence` existed are retired the same way (fail
 *      closed).
 *
 * BOUND ON THE GUARANTEE: the runtime handler reads the LIVE
 * `agentState.base2ActiveWork` during a step, so the ledger it sees is whatever
 * base2 wrote at the last gate pass. A model that edits files and marks the task
 * done inside the SAME step is therefore still outside supersession's reach.
 * The property is "this receipt was true as of the last gate pass", not an
 * airtight proof at the moment of the transition.
 *
 * PRODUCTION READERS (no field here is documented-but-unread):
 *   - base2.ts `prunePlanTaskGateReceipts` reads `receiptId`, `taskId`, `files`,
 *     and `snapshotFingerprint`;
 *   - base2.ts `supersedePlanTaskGateReceiptsForChangedFiles` reads `evidence`
 *     and `files`;
 * - base2.ts's gate-pass mint site reads `taskId` (one live receipt per task)
 *     and `receiptId` (an identical ID is the idempotent repeat pass and is left
 *     untouched rather than churning `recordedAt`); the opt-in committed-
 *     surface mint reuses the same one-live-receipt-per-task REPLACE semantics
 *     with `receiptId` derived by `committedSurfaceReceiptId`;
 *   - base2.ts's gate-pass `add_message` reads `taskId`, `receiptId`,
 *     `evidence`, and `files.length` for the printed evidence sentence;
 *   - base2.ts `buildPinnedActiveWorkMessage` reads `receiptId`, `taskId`, and
 *     `evidence` for the durable recovery line (pinned state survives context
 *     compaction, which is what makes a superseded ID recoverable);
 *   - the runtime `update_plan_status` handler's
 *     `readGateIssuedPlanTaskReceipts` reads `receiptId` and `taskId`, and
 *     `validatePlanTransition` matches them against `checkpoint.receiptIds` and
 *     lists the live IDs for the task when it rejects.
 * `validationSummary`, `reviewerVerdict`, and `recordedAt` are durable audit
 * fields surfaced through gate state itself; no decision branches on them.

   * 2. The field stays written for one deprecation window so a session
   *    serialized by an older base2 keeps round-tripping unchanged (no
   *    migration step, no rollback risk: it is additive and optional).
   * 3. Removal: once no serialized state in circulation is read by a base2 that
   *    still declares it, drop the write in base2.ts's gate-pass path, drop the
   *    `??= ''` default, drop this field, and drop the test-fixture seeds. Older

   * Gate-issued per-task validation receipts (see `Base2PlanTaskGateReceipt`),
   * written only on base2's FRESH validation/reviewer gate-pass path while a
   * plan task is claimed. MUST stay a plain JSON-serializable array (never a
   * Map/Set) and is bounded to the most recent 24 entries at every write site,
   * the same convention as `reviewReceipts`, so durable state cannot grow
   * without bound across a long plan run. base2's hydration ENFORCES that
   * shape: a present-but-non-array value (corrupt or hand-edited serialized
   * state) is normalized to an EMPTY array instead of being left intact, so
   * every reader fails closed instead of throwing a TypeError mid-turn while
   * the key stays PRESENT and gate-issued verification stays active (see
   * below).
   *
   * This is a ledger of receipts that are TRUE RIGHT NOW, not an append-only
   * history: at most one receipt is live per task (a new mint replaces that
   * task's previous one over the remaining entries), content verification drops
   * any receipt whose covered bytes no longer hash to its `snapshotFingerprint`,
   * and change supersession drops receipts a recorded change invalidated. Both
   * mechanisms PRUNE the array; neither ever deletes the key, because presence
   * is what keeps verification active (see below).
   *
   * Its PRESENCE is the signal that gate-issued verification is active: the
   * `update_plan_status` handler forwards this array to
   * `validatePlanTransition`, which then requires the checkpoint to cite a
   * gate-issued receipt ID for the task being completed. A PRESENT array —
   * including an EMPTY one — rejects (the gate is active but has issued no
   * evidence yet). When the key is ABSENT the handler falls back to the
   * pre-existing "any non-empty receiptIds" rule, which is what keeps non-base2
   * agents and a base2 run with the validation gate disabled
   * (`hasNoValidation` / plan-only, where no receipt could ever be minted) able
   * to complete plan tasks. base2 therefore initializes this key only when the
   * gate actually runs, and DELETES an inherited key on a gate-disabled turn:
   * the invariant is "present ⇔ the gate is active for THIS run", not "present ⇔
   * the gate ran at some point in this session". Without that deletion a session
   * that published the key under EXECUTE_PLAN/base2 and later resumed through a
   * gate-disabled variant would restore verification with no way to mint
   * evidence, making every new plan task impossible to move to `done`. Dropping
   * the stale ledger is safe: the next fresh gate pass re-mints a receipt for
   * whatever task is claimed then.
