 *   loop throws (the retry loop does NOT retry auth errors since they're not
 *   in RETRYABLE_STATUS_CODES, so the outer failover loop sees them right

 * - 500/502/503/504 (server): retryable, so the inner loop retries first; if
 *   retries exhaust, the outer loop failovers.
 * - 429 (rate limit): retry-only. Failover on 429 risks cascading load across
