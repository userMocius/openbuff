# Changelog

All notable changes to the @openbuff/sdk package will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New registered `recall_context` tool (`common/src/tools/params/tool/recall-context.ts`, runtime handler `packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/tool/recall-context.ts`): the recall leg of compaction. It searches archived pre-compaction transcripts (`AgentState.compactionArchive`) for verbatim facts a compaction pass removed from visible context. Input is a single `query` (2..512 chars, case-insensitive AND-match terms); the output carries bounded `matches` (`step`/`toolName`/`toolCallId`/`snippet`), `snapshotsSearched`, and `archivedAt` provenance so pre-compaction content is marked stale-until-verified, or a `message` hint when nothing matched. Results are budgeted per call (max 6 snippets of 600 chars) and the archive itself never enters the model context. Additive: agents that never call it are unaffected, and regenerated tool-definition sources land in the same commit.
- New optional `AgentState.compactionArchive` field (`common/src/types/session-state.ts`, shape in `common/src/types/context-archive.ts`): capped in-memory archive of pre-compaction transcripts written by the runtime before a semantic pass or mechanical trim rewrites history (max 8 snapshots × 200 messages, 4k chars/message, identity-deduped). Optional and plain JSON, so persisted sessions from before the field existed parse cleanly. Read only by `recall_context` results; never injected into requests.
- PROTOTYPE, canary-gated OFF by default: background LLM consolidation of archived snapshots (`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/context-consolidation.ts` + `context-consolidation-runner.ts`). A template that sets `programmaticConfig.backgroundSnapshotConsolidation === true` lets the runtime fire a fire-and-forget prompt-only LLM child after each compaction settle that summarizes up to 3 not-yet-consolidated archive snapshots (oldest first, char-budgeted newest-first prompt) into a bounded summary stored on the new optional `AgentState.contextConsolidations` field (shape in `common/src/types/context-consolidation.ts`; max 8 summaries × 6k chars). The child has no tools and no transcript write-back — its only product is the summary string — it never delays the agent step, and its failure is logged and dropped. `recall_context` gains an additive optional `consolidations` output section (OR-ranked summaries with `sourceArchivedAts` staleness provenance, max 3 hits), omitted entirely when no consolidations exist, so consumers and sessions that never enable the canary see the exact previous output contract. The background child costs one small LLM call per consolidation run; keep the canary off unless that spend is wanted.
- Deterministic tool-result eviction (`evictStaleToolResults` in `packages/agent-runtime/src/util/tool-result-eviction.ts`) is now importance-aware: it accepts `protectedPaths` (derived from task memory via `deriveProtectedEvictionPaths`), so a stale tool result whose content references a path recorded in task-memory evidence/inspected-files/edits is never tombstoned. Callers that pass nothing keep the previous recency-only behavior.
- Post-compaction extraction verification (`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/compaction-verification.ts`): after a semantic pass, expected facts derived from the PRE-compaction transcript (paths read or written, truncated commands) are checked against the post-compaction history and task memory; gaps are named in the `context_compaction` event's `recovery` guidance. The `recovery` string can now reference `recall_context`; consumers already treat it as opaque text, so no migration is required.
- New additive, read-only `auditTaskMemoryV1Migration` API and `V1MigrationAuditOutcome` type inspect a checksum-verified V1 record against a V2 repository without appending or mutating. An `exact` result reconstructs every deterministic source-derived task/observation event from the source and the marker session, then compares full schema-normalized headers and payloads (excluding only envelope `sequence`) plus all marker metadata. It is lossless only when `omittedFields === 0`, `(truncatedFields ?? 0) === 0`, and `warnings.length === 0`. Other outcomes distinguish no record, not migrated, incomplete, mismatch, rejected, and failed states using bounded reason codes rather than repository error text.
- New additive, read-only `inspectPersistedTaskMemoryV1` API and `TaskMemoryV1Inspection` type distinguish `absent`, checksum-verified `valid`, `invalid` (malformed JSON, schema invalid, or checksum mismatch), and `unreadable` records without exposing paths, contents, validation issues, or raw errors. The legacy `loadPersistedTaskMemory` signature and behavior are unchanged and now delegate to the inspector, collapsing every non-valid result to `undefined` for compatibility.
- Release N deprecation guidance: `json-v1` and `shadow-v2` remain supported compatibility modes but are deprecated; `sqlite-v2-opt-in` is the default and replacement. This release does not remove V1 APIs or persistence, migration import, authority selection, shadow behavior, or fallback behavior, sets no removal date/version, and does not claim migration is complete. Any removal requires a later release decision after the normative gates in the [Memory V1 removal readiness plan](../docs/memory-v1-removal-readiness.md) pass; `not-migrated` means removal is not ready, not that the product is defective.

- New published task-memory API for durable cross-session task state: `loadPersistedTaskMemory`, `reconcileTaskMemoryEvidence`, `saveMergedTaskMemory`, `pruneStaleTaskMemoryEvidence`, and `codebuffFsToNodePromises`, backed by `.openbuff/memory/task-memory.json` under the project root. The complete type closure those signatures name is published alongside them so consumers can name every parameter and return type: `TaskMemoryV1`, `TaskMemoryDraftV1`, and `TaskMemoryEvidenceV1` (re-exported from `@codebuff/common/types/task-memory`), plus `TaskMemoryStoreFs`, `WorkspaceMoveRecord`, and `TaskMemoryPruneOutcome`.
  - `pruneStaleTaskMemoryEvidence` returns a discriminated `TaskMemoryPruneOutcome` rather than a nullable count pair, so "there is no record" (`status: 'no-record'`) is distinguishable from "the prune could not be committed" (`status: 'failed'`, with `reason: 'invalid-record' | 'concurrent-write' | 'write-failed'` and the `removed`/`remaining` counts the prune would have written). A successful prune is `status: 'pruned'`, including the no-op `removed: 0` case for a fully fresh record.
  - `task-memory.json` has two writers, so `revision` stays monotonic and unique across both. `saveMergedTaskMemory` re-reads the on-disk record and merges against whichever of it and the caller's `priorMemory` is newer, emitting one revision past both; pruning refuses to write when the record advanced while it was reconciling. A session that hydrated a pre-prune record therefore cannot resurrect pruned evidence under an already-published revision.
  - Persistence requires the optional `renameFile` capability on a supplied `CodebuffFileSystem`: without it a save degrades to a skipped write (`undefined`) and a prune reports `reason: 'write-failed'`, rather than writing non-atomically.
- New additive `context_request_trim` `PrintModeEvent` variant on the public `handleEvent` surface (`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`), reporting the SDK's request-time emergency trim — the last line of defense applied at dispatch when an outgoing request's messages still exceed the provider-safe budget after every runtime brake ran. It is emitted only when that trim actually dropped messages, and it is a **different** event from `context_compaction` (which reports the runtime-owned semantic and mechanical passes): a `context_request_trim` means those earlier brakes were exceeded, so the two must not be merged or counted as one pass. Required fields are `messageBudgetTokens` (the message-only budget actually applied: the resolved request budget minus the counted system + tool surface), `beforeTokens`/`afterTokens`, and `beforeMessages`/`afterMessages`. `runId`, `ancestorRunIds`, `agentId`, `resolvedContextWindowTokens`, and `model` are optional, with the same correlation semantics as `context_compaction_status`: `runId`/`ancestorRunIds` are forwarded verbatim (`ancestorRunIds` empty only for the root run) while `agentId` is a display hint that subagent forwarding rewrites at nesting depth >= 2. Adding an event variant is non-breaking: consumers should treat unknown `event.type` values as no-ops, and consumers that only read runtime-owned compaction can ignore it entirely. No migration is required. Full contract in `docs/agents-and-tools.md` under "Context-window-aware compaction budgets".
- New optional `compactionTriggerTokens` and `compactionTargetTokens` on the existing `context_window` `PrintModeEvent` variant (`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`). They report the runtime's model-aware semantic-compaction budget for the active model — exactly the values `getSemanticCompactionBudget` returns for the resolved context window — so a UI can show at what point compaction will fire. The required `used`/`max` pair is unchanged and both new fields are optional, so this is additive and non-breaking: persisted or replayed events emitted before the fields existed still validate, and a consumer that ignores them keeps its previous behavior. No migration is required.
- New optional `onRequestContextTrimmed` callback on the published `promptAiSdk`, `promptAiSdkStream`, and `promptAiSdkStructured` signatures, together with its exported payload type `RequestContextTrimInfo` (`common/src/types/contracts/llm.ts`, implemented in `sdk/src/impl/llm.ts`). It reports the same request-time trim as the `context_request_trim` event, with `messageBudgetTokens`, `beforeTokens`/`afterTokens`, `beforeMessages`/`afterMessages`, and optional `contextWindowTokens`/`model`, and fires only when the trim actually dropped messages. It is purely observational: the callback can never affect the trim result, and a throwing consumer is caught and logged rather than aborting dispatch. The parameter is optional, so existing callers that omit it are unaffected and no migration is required.
- New optional `CodebuffFileSystem` capability `streamDirectory` for lazy (bounded-memory) directory iteration, exported alongside its `CodebuffStreamDirectory` type. `list_directory` uses it to stop one entry past the entry cap instead of materializing whole directories. Implementers must (a) release the directory handle from the iterator's `return()`, which breaking out of `for await` invokes, and (b) set `streamDirectory.readdirView` to the adapter's own `readdir`. Callers ignore the capability when `readdirView` is not the adapter's current `readdir`, so an adapter that decorates `createNodeFileSystem()` (spread or `Object.create()`) and overrides `readdir` keeps serving its own view instead of the host filesystem. The capability is deliberately not named `opendir` so adapters inheriting from `fs.promises` are never auto-detected.
- New exported predicate `supportsStreamDirectory(fs)` for detecting the `streamDirectory` capability. It is the supported way to observe whether an adapter provides streaming directory iteration, because presence of the member is only half the contract: the predicate also applies the `readdirView` pairing, so it always agrees with the path `list_directory` takes. `detectFilesystemCapabilities()` is unchanged and still reports member-presence capabilities only.
- New exported constant `MAX_LIST_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES`, the `list_directory` entry cap. It is the supported way to obtain the cap now that the over-cap `errorMessage` no longer reports an observed entry count, so consumers that parsed the count no longer need to parse the message at all.
- New optional telemetry fields on the `context_compaction` `PrintModeEvent` variant consumed by the public `handleEvent` surface (`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`): `runId`, `ancestorRunIds`, `agentId`, `resolvedContextWindowTokens`, `triggerBudgetTokens`, `targetBudgetTokens`, `compactionCount`, `consecutiveNoProgressCompactions`, `shortfallTokens`, `fitsBudget`, and `escalated`, plus the new optional `evictedTokens` and `evictedCount` reporting the tokens/messages the deterministic tool-result evictor freed in the same iteration (additive and optional like the rest). Every field is optional, so this is an additive, non-breaking change: persisted or replayed events emitted before the telemetry existed still validate, and consumers that ignore the fields keep their previous behavior. No migration is required. `runId`/`ancestorRunIds` identify the emitting agent run (`ancestorRunIds` is empty only for the root run) and are forwarded verbatim by every hop, which also scopes `compactionCount`: it counts the emitting run's own passes rather than a per-turn total across nested runs, so only the root run's count may be adopted as a turn total. `agentId` is stamped by the emitting run but is **not** a stable per-agent key on the delivered payload: the `spawn_agents` forwarding path overwrites it with the direct child's agent id on forwarded compaction events, so at nesting depth >= 2 it identifies the nearest forwarding child rather than the emitter. Key per-agent state off `runId` and treat `agentId` as a display hint. Full contract in `docs/agents-and-tools.md` under "Context-window-aware compaction budgets".
- New additive `context_compaction_status` `PrintModeEvent` variant on the public `handleEvent` surface (`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`), reporting live compaction state as `state: 'started' | 'settled'` with the required agent/run correlation `runId` and `ancestorRunIds` (plus optional `agentId`) and optional `contextTokens`, `resolvedContextWindowTokens`, `triggerBudgetTokens`, `targetBudgetTokens`, and `evictedTokens`. It is a separate event from the terminal `context_compaction` result, whose shape is otherwise unchanged. `started` is emitted before a programmatic step whose window-derived semantic trigger is exceeded AND whose run's loop-local token-state compaction governor allows the pass (a cooldown/rearm/pacing gate that bounds how often the expensive semantic pass may run per turn, with an emergency override at the provider-safe limit), and a matching `settled` with the same `runId` always follows, so a pass that decides not to compact leaves no pending state behind. The emission condition does **not** require the agent to have a `handleSteps` generator, because a prompt-only template gets an equivalent runtime-driven pass, but it is suppressed for a governor-denied iteration and for an iteration where the transient anti-thrash advisory is active (consecutive passes reclaimed no context space this turn), so a suppressed iteration emits neither half of the pair. `evictedTokens`, when present, reports tokens freed by the deterministic tool-result evictor in the same iteration — reclaim that cost no LLM call. Every `loopAgentSteps` invocation emits these events (root turn, foreground subagents, inline agents), so consumers must pair `started`/`settled` by `runId` and treat only an empty `ancestorRunIds` as the root run; otherwise nested loops cross-settle each other's pending state and a subagent's compaction renders as root-level live UI. Pair and key on `runId`, never on `agentId`: subagent forwarding rewrites `agentId` to the nearest forwarding child's agent id, so it does not identify the emitter at nesting depth >= 2. Adding an event variant is non-breaking: as with `job_update`, consumers should treat unknown `event.type` values as no-ops, and consumers that only read the final compaction result can ignore it entirely. No migration is required. Full contract in `docs/agents-and-tools.md` under "Context-window-aware compaction budgets".
- New optional `AgentState.suppressSemanticCompaction` boolean (`common/src/types/session-state.ts`), reachable by consumers through `RunState.sessionState.mainAgentState` and persisted alongside the rest of agent state. It is a transient, loop-owned anti-thrash advisory: `loopAgentSteps` sets it for the remainder of a turn whose consecutive semantic compaction passes measurably reclaimed no context space, and both pruner spawn paths — the runtime-driven pass and `spawn_agent_inline` — then decline to spawn the `context-pruner` for that turn. It is additionally set on an over-trigger iteration the loop's compaction governor denies, so the generator-driven inline spawn path honors the same pacing; below the trigger the field keeps its streak-based semantics. The field is optional, so this is an additive, non-breaking change: state persisted before it existed still loads, and consumers that ignore it keep their previous behavior. No migration is required. It is never authoritative across turns — `loopAgentSteps` resets it to `undefined` at loop entry — so a persisted or inherited `true` must not be read as a durable "semantic compaction disabled" setting, and writing `true` into resumed state only affects a turn that reads it before that reset. Budgets are not lowered and pinned state is not dropped by the advisory.
- The full `CodebuffFileSystem` type closure is now exported from the SDK (`CodebuffFileContent`, `CodebuffFileSystemBase`, `CodebuffRangeReadResult`, `CodebuffConditionalMoveOptions`, `CodebuffConditionalMoveResult` in addition to the previously published aliases), so a consumer's generated `.d.ts` resolves an adapter implementation without reaching into unpublished internals.

### Changed

- **`saveChunkSidecar` now returns `Promise<boolean>` instead of `Promise<void>`.** `true` means the validated sidecar was written atomically under the cache lock; `false` means the strict validator or the entry-count check rejected the input and the prior sidecar (if any) was left intact, so callers should fall back to `chunkId`/inline chunks instead of assuming the write landed. A `Promise<boolean>` return is assignable wherever a `Promise<void>` callback was expected, so `Promise<void>`-typed persistence adapters keep compiling; consumers built against the previous `.d.ts` should re-baseline against the boolean contract and branch on the result rather than treating every call as a committed write.

- **Prompt-only agents can now get a semantic compaction pass, opt-in via `spawnableAgents`.** A template without a `handleSteps` generator no longer relies solely on the mechanical trim: when the window-derived semantic trigger is exceeded, the runtime drives one `context-pruner` pass itself. That spawn goes through the same spawn-permission contract as `spawn_agent_inline`, so it only happens for base agents or for a template that declares `context-pruner` in its `spawnableAgents`. A consumer-authored agent that does not declare it is unaffected: no extra child LLM run is paid for and its transcript is never rewritten by the pruner. Declare `context-pruner` in `spawnableAgents` to opt in.

- **`spawn_agent_inline` pruner identity is now matched by bare agent id.** The pruner-specific inline contract was previously keyed off exact `agent_type === 'context-pruner'` string equality; it now goes through `isContextPrunerAgentId`, which normalizes the resolved agent id and compares only its bare segment. Any agent whose bare id is `context-pruner` — including `acme/context-pruner`, `acme/context-pruner@1.2.3`, and underscore aliases such as `context_pruner` — now receives the full pruner treatment it previously got only when spelled exactly `context-pruner`:
  - the full parent transcript (`messageHistoryMode: 'full'`) instead of the bounded `pinned` inline default, plus forced `inheritParentSystemPrompt: true`;
  - fully silenced child output — no text, tool, or subagent events from that child reach the client;
  - write-back of the child's transcript over the parent's `messageHistory`;
  - the operative pruner params the runtime injects into a serialized `handleSteps` (`run-programmatic-step.ts`): the model-aware `semanticBudget`, the parent's `taskMemory` and `workspaceState`, and the caller's `maxContextLength` clamped to the resolved model message limit. These were previously injected only for the exact `context-pruner` spelling, so a publisher-qualified or version-pinned pruner fell back to its embedded budget arithmetic and published `expectedTaskMemoryRevision: -1`; with parent task memory present (the normal root-agent case) its transactional `set_messages` was then rejected and the announced compaction silently did not happen. Identity is matched over both the resolved template id and the spawned `agentType`;
  - the transient `suppressSemanticCompaction` anti-thrash skip, which declines the spawn (after its input is validated) for the rest of a turn whose consecutive semantic passes reclaimed no context space. A declined spawn returns the usual `{ result, agentReceipt }` envelope with `status: 'cancelled'` and the skip reason as its output, but its `agentReceipt.agentId` is a synthetic per-skip marker: no child ran, so it appears in no persisted `spawn_started`/`spawn_finished` orchestration-ledger pair and in no task-memory receipt record. Do not use it as a spawn-correlation key.
  - Only an agent whose bare id is literally `context-pruner` is affected, so an agent published under any other bare id behaves exactly as before. Migration: if you published a non-pruner agent under the bare id `context-pruner` and do not want transcript write-back and output silencing, rename it to a different bare id.

- **Consumer-visible request-time trim budget tightened.** The SDK's request-time emergency-brake trim (`getMessagesForModelContext`, applied on both the streaming and non-streaming request paths) now subtracts the tokens actually consumed by that request's system prompt and tool schemas from the resolved message limit, instead of giving the whole limit to messages alone. The effective message budget is therefore `resolvedMessageLimit - systemTokens` (clamped so the budget is never <= 0), which mirrors the way the runtime's `maybePruneContext` reserves system-prompt and tool tokens before trimming. Treat that as the same _shape_ of budget, not an identical number: the SDK counts this request's own tool objects (exact for names, descriptions and plain JSON Schemas; opaque Zod/Standard Schema instances are converted to a real JSON Schema and counted from that projection, clamped between a per-tool floor and a per-tool ceiling and falling back to the floor when the conversion is not possible, and 0 when the provider-compatibility layer strips tools), while the runtime counts its own serialized tool definitions against a limit that may additionally be capped by a provider `maxContextLength`. The two counts are computed from different projections of the tool surface and can diverge substantially for the same model, so do not assume a request trimmed by one brake would be trimmed by the other. Consequences to expect:
  - Requests whose messages previously fit exactly under the flat limit can now have their oldest messages dropped. Nothing needs to change for correctness — the trim is still a last-resort brake below semantic compaction — but consumers that asserted on an exact retained-message count or on the total token size of a dispatched request must re-baseline against the smaller message budget. A larger system prompt or tool surface now shrinks the message budget one-for-one.
  - The `CACHE_EMERGENCY_TRIM` warning log text changed: it now also reports `systemTokens=<n>` and `messageBudget=<n>` after the existing `trigger=`/`target=` fields. The `cache_emergency_trim` analytics event gains the matching `systemTokens` and `effectiveMessageBudgetTokens` properties; `maxTotalTokens` keeps its previous meaning (the resolved request budget, not the message-only budget). Consumers that scrape the log line must match its prefix rather than the tail.
  - `triggerBudgetTokens`/`targetBudgetTokens` — in both the log payload and the `cache_emergency_trim` analytics properties, and the `trigger=`/`target=` numbers in the log text — now report the threshold actually applied to messages, i.e. the message-only budget (`effectiveMessageBudgetTokens`, equal to `maxTotalTokens - systemTokens`). They previously reported `maxTotalTokens`, which after this change is the pre-subtraction request budget and no longer the threshold a message-token comparison should use. When no system/tool overhead is supplied (`systemTokens` absent or `0`) both fields still equal `maxTotalTokens`, so those consumers see no change; a consumer that compares either field against message token counts while a system surface is counted must re-baseline against the smaller value.

- **Consumer-visible tool output:** both `list_directory` `errorMessage` texts changed. Match on the prefixes, not the tails.
  - Over the entry cap: `Directory listing too large: more than 5000 entries. List a specific subdirectory instead.`. The observed entry count and the previous `exceeds limit of 5000` phrasing are gone: the bounded read stops one entry past the cap, so the true total is never known. Consumers that parsed a count or matched `exceeds limit of` must match `Directory listing too large:` instead, and read the cap from the exported `MAX_LIST_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES` constant.
  - Any other failure: `Failed to list directory '<path>'`, with an optional ` (ERRNO)` suffix, replacing the previous `Failed to list directory: <fs message>` shape. The raw filesystem message is no longer echoed because it can name absolute paths the call never resolved; only the caller-supplied logical path and a canonical errno token are reported. Consumers that read the filesystem message out of the tail must use the errno suffix.

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** the `apply_patch` built-in tool has been removed from the published tool set (`publishedTools`/`PublishedToolName`), the client tool-call schema, the runtime tool handlers, and the SDK applicator.
- **BREAKING:** `apply_patch` is also gone from the generated agent type definitions (`agents/types/tools.ts` and the fresh-install template): the `'apply_patch'` member of the `ToolName` union, the `apply_patch` key of `ToolParamsMap`, and the `ApplyPatchParams` interface no longer exist.

### Migration guide: `apply_patch` → `edit_transaction`

- Use `edit_transaction` for all partial edits. Its `{ type: 'patch', diff }` edit type replaces `apply_patch` unified-diff patches, and it also supports `delete` and `move` edit types for removing or relocating files.
- Consumers that declare `toolNames: ['apply_patch']` must remove it from the list: unknown tool names are filtered out at runtime, so the entry no longer resolves to any tool.
- Consumers that supply `overrideTools` keyed by `PublishedToolName` must drop the `apply_patch` key; it is no longer a valid published tool name. Override `edit_transaction` instead if custom behavior is needed.
- Custom-agent authors hit this at compile time first. Update generated-type usages:
  - `ToolName` no longer includes `'apply_patch'`, so `const t: ToolName = 'apply_patch'` and any `toolNames: ToolName[]` literal containing it now fail to type-check. Use `'edit_transaction'`.
  - `ToolParamsMap['apply_patch']` no longer resolves; use `ToolParamsMap['edit_transaction']` (`EditTransactionParams`).
  - The exported `ApplyPatchParams` interface is deleted; typed `handleSteps` code that imported or referenced it should use `EditTransactionParams` instead.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-29

First public release of `@openbuff/sdk` (forked lineage from Codebuff SDK; see `docs/codebuff-to-openbuff-migration.md`).

### Added — Provider layer

- Multi-provider router with per-model failover chains and retry config (`ProviderConfig`, `RetryConfig`). Honors provider-declared `context.windowTokens` with a safe fallback when absent.
- New built-in tools: `git_branch`, `git_status`, `str_replace` (with `edit_transaction` atomic batch), `read_subtree`, `read_outline`, `read_image`, `query_index`, `code_search`, `run_terminal_command`, `list_directory`, `glob`, `file_picker`.
- Cost accounting + token usage tracking per run, surfaced in `RunResult.output`.
- `skillsDir` SDK option to load custom skills from a directory.
- `code_map` indexer: tree-sitter-powered symbol extraction with `query_index` graph edges, reference/blast-radius mode, and deterministic `.openbuff.d/indexing.json` schema.

### Added — Agent runtime

- `base2` orchestrator with a validation/reviewer gate, gate-repair loop, coverage verdicts, craftsmanship prompt sections, and session-state `AgentOutput` schema.
- Bundled agents: `debugger`, `doc-writer`, `git-committer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-writer`, `librarian`, `context-pruner`, `researcher`, `thinker`, `synthesizer`.
- Subagent timeouts, background agents, budget enforcement, and parallel I/O for `read_files` / `read_image`.
- `handleSteps` generators now receive `hitStepCap` in `TNext` so orchestrators can break out on the step cap instead of falling through to the gate.

### Fixed

- `suggest_followups` is now retracted mid-step the moment a file-changing tool executes (both in `base2`'s edits-detected blocks and in `tool-executor.ts`), preventing same-step follow-up suggestions after edits.
- Step-cap early-return no longer causes an infinite validation/reviewer gate loop: `runAgentStep` returns `hitStepCap`, threaded through `loopAgentSteps` → `runProgrammaticStep` → `generator.next({ hitStepCap })`, and `base2` breaks out of its `while(true)` when it fires.
- `runAgentStep` resolves the agent's model from `agentId` before failover, fixing the "Agent run error: undefined" regression.
- `prebuild-agents.ts` requires only `definition.id` (not `definition.model`), so all 30 valid agents bundle into the CLI binary instead of just the two with hardcoded models.
- `write_file` is deterministic — no longer expands `// ... rest of the function ...` snippets. Use `str_replace` or `edit_transaction` for partial edits.
- Provider config honors `context.windowTokens`; missing values fall back to a safe default.

### Changed

- Agent runs no longer have a fixed step cap by default. Unset or `-1` `maxAgentSteps` means unlimited productive steps; a repeated-step watchdog stops six identical no-progress patterns while cancellation, subagent timeouts, budgets, spawn-depth limits, and context compaction remain active.
- Removed `isLocalMode` / `localMode` flag and the `LOCAL_MODE_API_KEY` sentinel; local-mode plumbing and hosted-backend DB/auth/email surfaces purged.
- Debug-log message history capped to the last 50 messages to bound memory.
- Removed dead `_sendSubagentChunk` and per-iteration `cloneDeep`.

## [0.10.7]

- New code editing tool `apply_patch` which works well with Codex models (e.g. openai/gpt-5.3-codex). (Removed in a later release; see the `[Unreleased]` migration guide — use `edit_transaction` instead.)
- `write_file` is now a deterministic tool that creates or replaces the file. Previously, it also accepted edit snippet comments which could expand to keep a portion of the previous file, e.g. "// ... rest of the function ...". That behavior is removed to keep things simple. `str_replace` or `apply_patch` should be used if not overwriting the whole file. (`apply_patch` has since been removed; use `edit_transaction` — see the `[Unreleased]` migration guide.)
