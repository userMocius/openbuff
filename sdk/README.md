# Openbuff SDK

Openbuff is a local-first, BYOK coding-agent SDK. Filesystem tools run against
the host-provided `CodebuffFileSystem`; provider credentials and model routing
remain under the host's control.

## Recommended filesystem setup

New runs default to structured `read_files` v1 results. Use
`filesystemResultFormat: 'legacy-v0'` only for an existing compatibility
integration. During agent runs, complete reads carry authenticated `cap.v3`
tokens bound to the current project, normalized path, and run; SDK callers
should treat them as opaque and copy them only to the matching edit target.

When `run()` receives a `cwd` and no custom `fsSource`, the SDK creates a
workspace-scoped mutation broker under the harness state directory. The broker
supplies bounded line-range reads plus cooperative, inter-process conditional
commit/delete/move and exclusive-create authority:

```ts
import { run } from '@openbuff/sdk'

await run({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  filesystemResultFormat: 'structured-v1',
  agent: 'base2',
  prompt: 'Update the project',
})
```

`createNodeFileSystem()` used by itself intentionally omits conditional
mutations and makes guarded updates fail closed. Hosts that need the same
brokered adapter outside `run()` can construct it explicitly:

```ts
import { createNodeFileSystem, WorkspaceMutationBroker } from '@openbuff/sdk'

const mutationBroker = await WorkspaceMutationBroker.create({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  stateDir: '/path/to/openbuff/state/harness',
})
const fsSource = createNodeFileSystem({ mutationBroker })
```

This is cooperative CAS among participating Openbuff processes, not absolute
kernel-enforced filesystem CAS. External editors can bypass the broker, so
workspace revision checks and filesystem watching remain the backstop for
outside mutations.

Custom adapters should implement the optional capabilities they can guarantee:

- `readTextRange` enables bounded reads of files larger than 10 MB.
- `streamDirectory` keeps `list_directory` lazy, stopping one entry past the
  listing cap instead of materializing every directory entry. Implementers must
  (1) release the directory handle from the iterator's `return()` — the method
  breaking out of `for await` invokes, which async generators and Node's `Dir`
  already do — and (2) set `readdirView` to the adapter's own `readdir`. A
  `readdirView` that is not the adapter's current `readdir` (for example after
  a decorating adapter overrides `readdir`) makes callers ignore the capability
  and fall back to full `readdir` materialization, with no diagnostic.
- `createFileExclusive` prevents create collisions.
- `conditionalCommit` prevents lost updates between validation and overwrite.
- `conditionalDelete` guards deletions with an exact-byte expected hash.
- `conditionalMove` requires the source hash and an absent destination.

Declare `streamDirectory` only when you can guarantee both obligations above:
the iterator releases its handle from `return()`, and `readdirView` is the
adapter's current `readdir`. A mis-paired `readdirView` silently disables the
capability — callers fall back to full `readdir` materialization with no
diagnostic. Confirm the finished wiring with `supportsStreamDirectory()`, not
by checking member presence:

```ts
import type fs from 'fs'
import type { Dirent } from 'fs'
import { supportsStreamDirectory } from '@openbuff/sdk'
import type { CodebuffFileSystem } from '@openbuff/sdk'

// Virtual directory store: path -> entries. Both views below serve this store.
const directories = new Map<string, Dirent[]>()

// The adapter's own `readdir` (a real one carries the full fs.promises
// overload set, elided here).
const readdir = (path: fs.PathLike): Promise<Dirent[]> =>
  Promise.resolve(directories.get(String(path)) ?? [])

// Breaking out of `for await` calls the generator's built-in `return()`, releasing the handle.
async function* iterate(path: fs.PathLike): AsyncGenerator<Dirent> {
  yield* directories.get(String(path)) ?? []
}

const streamDirectory: NonNullable<CodebuffFileSystem['streamDirectory']> =
  Object.assign((path: fs.PathLike) => iterate(path), { readdirView: readdir })

const adapter = { readdir, streamDirectory }
console.log(supportsStreamDirectory(adapter)) // true
```

Tools that require a host process, such as terminal commands and configured
validation hooks, are separate from the filesystem adapter. Virtual or remote
hosts should override or disable process-backed tools when the local process
does not represent the same workspace.

## High-impact action approvals

Approval behavior is controlled by `approvalMode`:

- `balanced` (default) allows routine dependency changes, commits, feature
  branch pushes, pull requests, ordinary downloads, normal pipelines/tests, and
  staged-only `git restore --staged` without prompting. It asks only for truly
  destructive workspace/history shapes (for example `git reset --hard`,
  `git clean -fd`, worktree-mutating restore, recursive deletes), default-branch
  pushes, deployments, releases, migrations, uploads/remote shells, and
  interpreter-eval / detached-process shapes — not ordinary pipes, command
  substitution in project scripts, or background jobs.
- `strict` asks for every classified package, Git, remote, or destructive
  effect.
- `allow-all` auto-approves classified effects while retaining non-negotiable
  project containment, secret filtering, no global/system installs, staged
  path ownership, and no force/delete pushes.

When approval is required, hosts can provide `requestApproval`; the callback
pauses the same tool call and returns a decision. Approved actions receive a
single-use receipt bound to the repository, workspace, root run, exact action
target, and current workspace snapshot, then continue immediately.

The CLI wires `requestApproval` to its existing in-run question UI. SDK hosts
may instead pre-create receipts with `HarnessApprovalService` and pass their IDs
through `approvalReceiptIds`. A receipt for a different command, run,
workspace, or snapshot is rejected; an agent cannot mint or broaden its own
approval.

## Terminal command permission profiles

**Note:** In the bundled runtime, all agents currently execute their terminal
commands under the `full-access` profile. The runtime handler
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/tool/run-terminal-command.ts`)
hardcodes `permission_profile: 'full-access'` for every agent, so the per-agent
profile gates described below (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `git-commit`,
`dependency-mutation`, `validation-diagnosis`, `tmux-test`,
`librarian-read-only`) are **not** enforced for bundled agents. Under
`full-access`, `evaluateTerminalCommandPolicy` bypasses every policy gate: no
path-containment/traversal checks, no temp restriction, no
read-only/env-dump/shell-indirection/sed/dependency/git denials, and no
per-profile allowlists. The profile catalog below is therefore the SDK helper's
contract, not the bundled per-agent enforcement: the profiles still exist in the
policy code and remain callable via the exported `evaluateTerminalCommandPolicy`
helper, so SDK hosts can still invoke any profile directly. The separate
high-impact-action approval gate (previous section) is UNCHANGED and still
applies on top of `full-access`.

`run_terminal_command` is gated by the exported
`evaluateTerminalCommandPolicy` helper, which decides whether a command may
run under an agent's permission profile. Hosts can call it directly to
evaluate the same policy outside the tool:

```ts
const decision = evaluateTerminalCommandPolicy({
  command: 'git status',
  mode: 'assistant',
  permissionProfile: 'git-commit',
  projectRoot: process.cwd(),
  allowedPaths: ['src/index.ts'],
})
// decision: { allowed: true } | { allowed: false, reason: string }
```

Inputs:

- `command` — the shell command line to evaluate.
- `mode` — `'assistant'` enforces the policy; `'user'` is always allowed
  (direct user input is not gated here).
- `permissionProfile` — one of the profiles below.
- `projectRoot` — the workspace root used for path-containment checks.
- `cwd` — optional in-project working directory. When provided, relative
  `..` tokens under `workspace-write` and `validation-diagnosis` resolve
  against this directory instead of `projectRoot`. The resolved path must
  still stay inside `projectRoot`; `cd ..` from the repo root stays denied.
- `allowedPaths` — optional owned-path allowlist, required for `git add`
  and `git restore --staged` under `git-commit`.

Profiles:

- `read-only` — inspection only. Blocks filesystem, Git, dependency, network,
  package/system, deployment, and process mutations, shell interpreter
  escapes, and unsafe redirection. `/dev/null` and file-descriptor redirects
  are tolerated.
- `librarian-read-only` — `read-only` plus a single narrow exception: a
  depth-1 `git clone` of a GitHub repo into a `/tmp/librarian-…` directory.
- `validation-diagnosis` — `read-only` relaxed for debugging: in-project `..`
  references are allowed (segments that escape the project root are still
  rejected), and `>`/`>>`/heredoc writes are permitted only to plain,
  expansion-free paths that resolve inside the project.
- `git-commit` — inspect/fetch Git state, stage explicit owned paths, create a
  non-`--amend` commit with `-m`/`--message`, and perform an explicit
  non-force branch push. `git add` and `git restore --staged` paths must be
  an exact subset of `allowedPaths`; broad flags, dot staging, options, and
  globs are forbidden.
  Whole-subject placeholder commit messages such as bare `probe`, `wip`,
  `test`, `tmp`, `update`, or `misc` are denied; real imperative subjects that
  merely contain those words stay allowed. Safe single-command branch/switch,
  create, safe delete (`branch -d`), merge, cherry-pick, stash, soft/mixed
  reset, tag create, and staged restore are allowed. Data-loss and history
  rewrite shapes stay denied (`reset --hard`, force/delete branch, `clean`,
  path checkout, rebase, amend, stash drop/clear, config writes, force switch,
  strategy overrides, worktree restore). Shell composition is allowed only
  between allowlisted read-only git inspection commands; staging, commit, and
  push remain single-command-only. Active substitution and unquoted
  redirection stay blocked.
- `dependency-mutation` — supported ecosystem dependency operations only
  (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun, uv/poetry, pip, cargo, go, dotnet, bundler, composer,
  swift, dart/flutter, mix, maven, gradle). Global/user-level installs, shell
  composition, and multi-line commands are blocked.
- `tmux-test` — inspection under a shell that cannot mutate the workspace.
  File writers, archive extractors, interpreters, compound shell syntax,
  active expansion/substitution, non-`/dev/null` redirects, and non-inspect
  Git commands are denied. Fixture creation is not authorized through the
  shell; use a dedicated terminal executor with private fixture creation.
  Outside-absolute-path containment and env-dump denial still apply.
- `workspace-write` — general workspace writes. Everyday bash (`for`/`if`/
  `while`/`case`, pipelines, and normal control flow) is allowed. In-project
  `..` references are allowed, including `cd ..` from a contained `cwd` that
  still lands inside the project; escaping segments are rejected. Command and
  process substitution (`$(...)`, backticks, `<(...)`) are inspected for env
  dumps rather than denied wholesale, so `echo $(date)` is allowed while
  `echo $(printenv)` is not. `gh pr create` and other GitHub PR mutation verbs
  are allowed here (they remain denied on `read-only` and stay routine in
  balanced harness approval).
- `full-access` — bypasses the policy gates. Use only through an explicit
  full-access workflow.

Containment applied to every non-`full-access` profile, including `tmux-test`:
path traversal (`..` segments, per the profile rules above) and absolute paths
that resolve outside the project root (with `/tmp`, `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, and
`/dev/null` exempted) are always denied.

In addition, every non-`full-access` profile except `tmux-test` always denies
privilege escalation (`sudo`/`su`), system package managers, root deletion,
force/delete pushes, and shell indirection (`eval`/`source`/`<shell> -c`).
Environment dumps (`env`/`printenv`/bare `set`/`export`, including wrapped,
path, busybox, execution-wrapper, double-quoted substitution, and process-
substitution forms such as `command printenv`, `env printenv`, `nice env`, or
`cat <(printenv)`; option-only `set -euo pipefail` and workspace-style
`export NAME[=value]` / `env NAME=value <utility>` remain allowed where the
profile permits) are denied for every non-`full-access` profile, including
`tmux-test`. Under `workspace-write` only, active `$()` / backticks /
process substitution are not treated as dumps unless a substitution body or
remaining segment actually dumps the environment; unextractable substitutions
do not fail closed as env-dump. `read-only`, `librarian-read-only`,
`validation-diagnosis`, `tmux-test`, `git-commit`, and `dependency-mutation`
still fail closed on substitution and unparseable composition for env-dump.
Under `read-only` / `librarian-read-only` / `validation-diagnosis`,
env mutation forms such as `export NAME=value` and `env NAME=value cmd` are
also denied. The `tmux-test` profile still skips the other workspace deny
patterns because it is governed by its own stricter no-shell-write guard
described above. When a command is denied, `reason` names the specific rule
that blocked it.

### Harness classification and basher (`workspace-write`) pitfalls

- Harness high-impact classification (`classifyTerminalHarnessAction`) no longer
  treats ordinary pipes, `$(...)` / backticks, or trailing `&` as
  `arbitrary-code`; interpreter `-e`/`-c` and `nohup`/`setsid` still do.
- `git restore --staged` is not high-impact; bare/worktree/patch restore is
  `workspace-delete`.
- **Basher (`workspace-write`) operational pitfalls:**
  - Prefer a project file + `bun path/to/script` over `bun -e` / `node -e`
    (those are classified as `arbitrary-code` and need approval in balanced
    mode).
  - Do not embed multi-KB heredocs or live `$()` that dump env in the basher
    `params.command` string — env dumps (`env`/`printenv`/bare `set`) stay
    denied even when ordinary `$(date)` / `$(pwd)` substitutions and `gh pr`
    are allowed under `workspace-write` and are not high-impact harness
    actions. Author files with edit tools; run short commands.
  - Durable local check (from monorepo root): `bun run check:ci-local` (the early-gates bundle: tool defs + memory-drift + sync-agent-config).

## Search tool working directory

`code_search` and `find_files_matching_content` accept a `cwd` that sets the
search root. The `cwd` is resolved with `realpath` and is not required to stay
inside the project root, so a search can target a parent, sibling, or other
external directory. Two cases still return an error result:

- a `cwd` that resolves to a file rather than a directory, and
- a `cwd` that does not exist or cannot be read.

This relaxation applies only to the two content-search tools. Path containment
for `run_terminal_command` and the other read/exec tools is unchanged (see the
permission profiles above).

## Mutation events

Use `onFilesystemMutation` for precise, awaited cache/index synchronization.
It receives the tool/call/operation identity and confirmed paths, actions, and
hashes. `onFilesChanged` remains as a compatibility callback.

External mutation overrides are conservatively reported as `unconfirmed`
unless the host supplies `verifyExternalMutation` and attests the canonical v1
result. This keeps remote-workspace integrations possible without trusting
self-certified mutation results by default.

## Result and cancellation semantics

- `applied` means the SDK verified final state and issued an authority receipt.
- `not_applied` means authority proved no requested action was committed.
- `unconfirmed` means the host or compatibility boundary cannot establish disk
  state; re-read before retrying.
- Run interruption and filesystem outcome are separate. A mutation may report
  an authoritative result after the run is interrupted.
- Native reads, images, patches, and validation hooks receive the run abort
  signal. Once a portable filesystem commit has started, hosts must still use
  the returned canonical result to determine final disk state.

## Public helpers

The root package exports structured read helpers, mutation helpers,
`FilesystemAuthority`, capability detection/types, the Node adapter, and the
complete `ToolHelpers` namespace. Override descriptor/context types are also
public for reusable host integrations.
