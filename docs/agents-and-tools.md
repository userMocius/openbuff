# Agents and Tools in Openbuff

Openbuff operates as an orchestrator of specialized, local-first agents. Instead of running model orchestration on a hosted backend, all agent loops, prompt generation, tool calls, and model routing are processed locally on your machine via the `agent-runtime` and `sdk` packages, utilizing your Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) providers.

## Agents

Agents in Openbuff can be either prompt-based or programmatic (utilizing `handleSteps` generator functions).

- Shipped agents reside in the `agents/` monorepo package.
- Project-local or custom agents live in the `.agents/` folder of your project.
- Programmatic agent generator functions execute in a secure sandbox. Calls yielded by `handleSteps` are restricted to declared `toolNames`, declared hidden `programmaticToolNames`, and a small runtime context-management allowlist; templates also define which subagents can be spawned.
- `spawnableAgentToolMode` controls the provider-facing spawn surface. The compatibility default, `direct`, creates one native tool schema per spawnable agent. `generic` keeps the same spawn permissions and compact capability catalog but routes calls through the single `spawn_agents` tool, substantially reducing baseline context. The shipped base orchestrators use `generic`.
- Local agent precedence is project `.agents` → parent `.agents` → home `~/.agents`. The loader preserves the winning source path for UI links, supports `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs`, and reports per-agent validation diagnostics instead of failing the entire registry.

### Orchestrator-spawnable vs. pattern-specific agents

Not every shipped agent is directly spawnable by the orchestrator (`base2` / `base-deep`). Agents fall into two categories:

**Orchestrator-spawnable agents** are listed in the `spawnableAgents` array of `base2.ts` and `base-deep.ts`. These are general-purpose specialists the orchestrator can delegate to at policy-defined phase boundaries: `file-picker`, `code-reviewer`, `editor`, `thinker`, `basher`, `researcher-web`, `researcher-docs`, `git-committer`, `debugger`, `doc-writer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-writer`, `librarian`, and others. `context-pruner` is runtime-internal and is not publicly spawnable. Adding an agent to `spawnableAgents` means the orchestrator may spawn it when the current phase and task scope make its capabilities relevant; it does not mean agents should be spawned randomly or for tiny direct-answer tasks.

Common phase triggers and routing policies:

- `file-picker`, `researcher-web`, `researcher-docs` — discovery phase when files, APIs, docs, or commands are not already obvious. Scope first as `tiny`, `focused`, `multi-file`, `cross-subsystem`, or `unknown surface`; scale reads/searches and parallel shards accordingly. For large-repo planning, do not use file-pickers as the only shards: they are discovery-focused and should be paired with direct code_search plus reasoning-capable general-agent shards when analysis is required.
- `general-agent` — focused reasoning/audit shards after discovery for larger repositories or complex domains. Give each shard explicit files or a narrow subsystem. Audit shards persist their own structured results with `write_audit_findings` and return only a compact artifact receipt, so the parent context carries paths/counts/hashes instead of every finding body.
- `thinker` — reasoning phase after context gathering for complex design, architecture, tradeoff, risk, spec/plan critique, or debugging strategy choices. Use it to synthesize discovered evidence when no file writes are needed; skip it for straightforward edits and never use it as a replacement for reading files.
- `editor` — implementation phase for non-trivial source changes, with a self-contained implementation brief because it does not rely on parent context. The five brief fields accept either colon labels (`Requirements:`) or normal Markdown headings (`## Requirements`). Skip it for tiny one-file edits and direct answers.
- `basher` — validation phase for tests, typechecks, lints, builds, or command discovery that lacks a dedicated harness tool. Prefer configured hooks and deterministic path-to-suite routing first, such as agents/base2 prompt/gate checks, SDK checks for `packages/sdk/*`, runtime checks for `packages/agent-runtime/*`, common/dependent checks for `common/*`, and CLI typecheck plus visual smoke for `cli/src/components/*` or `cli/src/hooks/*`.
  Basher requires `params.command`. For compatibility, `spawn_agents` repairs an explicit string-valued top-level `command` into `params.command` and decodes the bounded provider serialization `command</arg_key><arg_value>...` when it occurs directly in Basher params, but it never treats prompt prose as executable input. A spawn whose required params are genuinely absent is published with a structured failure result so the parent can inspect the validation error and retry safely.
  Prefer short project-script commands (`bun path/to/script`) over `bun -e` / `node -e` probes — interpreter eval is high-impact harness `arbitrary-code` and needs approval in balanced mode. Do not put env dumps or multi-KB heredocs / live `$()` env probes in `params.command`; terminal policy still denies those even when the harness classifier is quiet. Keep complex logic in project files authored with edit tools, and use `bun run smoke:harness` as the durable local classifier/policy check.
- `set_output` expects native object fields. Complete stringified JSON objects and exact JSON code-fence/comment wrappers are decoded for compatibility. Malformed or incomplete string data is never accepted as agent output; the call receives a recoverable tool result so the agent can retry without losing the structured-output contract.
- **Embedder contract note (set_output moved out of `programmaticToolNames`):** structured-output agents — `researcher-web` first — now declare `set_output` in `toolNames` (model-facing) with an empty `programmaticToolNames` list, instead of intercepting it at the `handleSteps` generator boundary. A host or harness that introspected `programmaticToolNames` to decide whether to intercept `set_output` programmatically will now see an empty list and must stop intercepting: the model self-calls `set_output`, and the runtime applies the structured-output contract (validation, recoverable failures) at the model-call boundary. Embedders that relied on generator-level interception must move that interception to the model tool-call path or accept the model-driven behavior.
- Native tool inputs use canonical provider schemas, while the shared compatibility parser repairs a bounded set of unambiguous model-generated shapes before validation. This includes singular/plural selectors (`path`/`paths`, `file`/`files`, `edit`/`edits`, `agent`/`agents`), single items for declared collection fields, and explicit camelCase/snake_case equivalents. Canonical fields win when both forms are present; truncated JSON, unknown aliases, and ambiguous shapes still fail validation.
- `dependency-manager` — explicit dependency-mutation phase only. It receives structured manager/operation/package/workspace inputs, constructs one bounded ecosystem-native command, and supports npm/pnpm/Yarn/Bun, uv/Poetry/pip, Cargo, Go modules, .NET, Bundler, Composer, SwiftPM, Dart/Flutter Pub, Mix, Maven dependency resolution, and Gradle dependency inspection. It cannot run arbitrary shell or global installs, and a missing-package diagnostic alone is not authorization to spawn it.
- `debugger` — repair phase after repeated validation failures, runtime failures, or unclear crash behavior.
- `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer` — review phase after meaningful edits or security-sensitive changes; blocking findings prevent completion. Security review is required for auth, crypto, secrets, permissions, injection, sandboxing, path/process/network handling, supply-chain, or production-risk changes.
- `test-writer`, `doc-writer` — coverage phase when tests or docs are required or directly implied by acceptance criteria.
- `git-committer` and release/deployment workflows — only when explicitly requested or confirmed; follow status inspection, remote/tag fetch, rebase/merge decision, push, CI/CD wait, release trigger, artifact/tag/package verification, and local branch sync/reporting.

Cross-cutting orchestration policy:

- Ask the user before destructive commands, public API/contract changes, dependency additions, schema/data migrations, release/publish/deploy actions, production-affecting scripts, or ambiguous product behavior.
- All agents now run terminal commands under the `full-access` permission profile: the runtime resolves every agent to `full-access` in `packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/tool/run-terminal-command.ts`, so the per-agent profile gates (`read-only`, the clone-scoped `librarian-read-only`, `workspace-write`, etc.) are not enforced for bundled agents. The profile catalog still exists in the SDK policy helper (`evaluateTerminalCommandPolicy`) for host use. Background commands are request-owned unless `detach` is explicitly requested.
- Browser-use defaults to `params.interactionPolicy: "read-only"`. Clicks, typing, uploads, evaluation, and other browser-state mutations require `allow-interactions`; each run receives an isolated browser session that is closed with the owning SDK run.
- `base2-plan` can spawn `basher`, `browser-use`, `debugger`, and `general-agent` for deep analysis. Plan-only authority propagates through descendants: terminal-capable children are clamped to the read-only terminal profile (this plan-only terminal attenuation is currently superseded by the global full-access override — the runtime resolves all agents to `full-access` — so it no longer takes effect in the bundled runtime) and browser interactions remain denied even if a child requests `allow-interactions`. Mutation agents and direct edit/terminal tools remain unavailable. The spawn batch limit (`MAX_SPAWN_BATCH_SIZE`, currently 12) is a concurrency bound; planners may launch additional joined waves until coverage is complete and can poll/cancel detached analysis with `check_background_agent`.
- Prefer dedicated tools over shell fallbacks: `git_status` for repo state, file/read/search tools for inspection, `read_image` for images, deterministic edit tools for edits, configured hooks for validation, and browser/CLI visual agents for smoke checks.
- Maintain durable plan artifacts in EXECUTE_PLAN at phase boundaries, blockers, validation/review results, and finalization.
- Parallelism is allowed for independent discovery shards, independent validation commands, and static review that does not depend on validation output. Dependent edits, fragile debug loops, and validation-repair cycles stay sequential.
- The orchestrator must join all required results before completion. Reviewers running alongside validation provide static review only; failed or timed-out validation still blocks a green finish.

### Agent restriction policy (relaxed vs keep)

Runtime agent restrictions keep real security boundaries while removing over-strict friction that blocked legitimate local work. Vulnerability reporting stays in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md); this section is product policy only.

**Keep (real security value):**

- SSRF host/IP/redirect revalidation on network fetches
- Denials for `.env`, private keys/credentials, and real `.tfstate` paths
- Project-path containment for reads/writes/spawned work
- `cap.v3` HMAC signing with project/path/run scope binding
- `replace_range` authority chain (authenticated capability, not prose hashes)
- Plan-only terminal attenuation (descendants stay on the read-only terminal profile) — currently overridden by the global full-access terminal profile, so it is no longer effective in the bundled runtime
- Privilege-escalation, system-package, and env-dump bans (these apply to the non-full-access policy profiles, still enforced for SDK hosts and the high-impact approval gate, not to bundled agents now on full-access)
- Force/delete/default-branch push gating
- Large-file scoped `basedOnRead` hard-fail when the anchor is required and invalid
- `str_replace` circuit-breaker non-draining success (limit 5)

**Relaxed (intentional friction reductions):**

- Empty handoff `readablePaths` / `writablePaths` no longer invent `[]` lockouts
- Handoff preserves static `spawnableAgents` and `programmaticToolNames`
- Git commit guide uses multiple `-m` flags (HEREDOC and `$()` remain blocked under the git-commit profile)
- Ripgrep expands combined short flags such as `-ni` and allows `-v` / `-c`
- `/git` pathspec allows `()[]{}` while still blocking shell operators
- Sensitive-path matching is more precise: no false positives on public certs/docs/examples/`yarnrc`; kubeconfig/tfstate use exact or suffix rules (real secret denials remain)
- In-project absolute POSIX paths are allowed; containment remains authoritative
- Higher throughput defaults with truncation/backstops kept: range read 4MB, live subtree 5000 nodes (`LIVE_SUBTREE_MAX_NODES`), web fetch 2MB / 150KB text, `code_search` `maxResults` 30, `find_files` `maxFiles` 250, spawn batch 12 (`MAX_SPAWN_BATCH_SIZE`)
- Small-file unique stale `basedOnRead` is auto-stripped so a unique exact match can proceed

### Harness control plane and specialist intelligence

The root orchestrator has a versioned, local control-plane surface for work that must survive compaction or concurrent worktree activity:

- `inspect_workspace` records repository/worktree identity, branch state, and a content snapshot.
- `get_task` reads the current durable task and lifecycle revision.
- `get_change_review_bundle` produces snapshot-bound changed-file and diff **evidence** for reviewers. Its bare hex `snapshotId` is evidence-only — gate/specialist/security attestation uses opaque gate-owned `v3:…` tokens (`snapshot_id` / `snapshot_fingerprint`), never bare bundle hex as credit identity. An empty or failed bundle must not clear specialist review when reviewable pending files still exist; specialists still spawn under the gate-owned v3 token.
- `inspect_environment` recursively reports nested JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Maven/Gradle, .NET, and Swift workspaces, their manifests/lockfiles, inferred managers with explicit confidence, and locally available toolchains without executing project code.
- `get_affected_tests` and `get_build_targets` map changed files to the nearest workspace, existing test candidates, and manager-specific validation/build commands. Targets report `confirmed`, `inferred`, or `unknown` confidence instead of presenting guesses as discovered facts.
- `run_targeted_validation` executes only an explicitly selected target against an expected snapshot and rejects stale or mid-run-mutated snapshots. It is **snapshot-scoped optional evidence only**: green targeted validation does **not** clear reviewer findings, does **not** unlock `git-committer`, and does **not** replace the validation/reviewer gate.
- `inspect_codebase_structure` creates the authoritative snapshot-bound audit inventory, including subsystems, entrypoints, routes, commands, public APIs, tests, generated sources, and a detected language/framework capability packet.
- `inspect_feature_completeness` follows a claimed feature vertically across runtime wiring, consumers, tests, docs, and failure-state evidence.
- `write_audit_findings` returns a snapshot-bound `structuralReceipt` when the shard supplies the exact snapshot and explicit domain coverage, and `inspect_feature_completeness` returns a `coverageReceipt`; pass those receipts directly to `evaluate_audit_coverage` instead of reconstructing them from prose or count summaries. Feature receipts remain heuristic until their cited files are verified with exact reads.
- `evaluate_audit_coverage` blocks a complete audit while structural receipts, verified feature evidence, or explicit out-of-scope decisions are missing. It accepts legacy camelCase receipt fields and the old `api-abi` domain as compatibility inputs, normalizing them to the canonical contract.

Cross-subsystem requests automatically invoke the structural inventory before the first model step. The legacy structural-map script is only a human-readable renderer over this inventory; normal CLI correctness does not depend on running it or writing into `.agents/`.

Specialists receive only the read intelligence their role requires. For example, dependency and performance review can inspect environment/build targets, while integration and release review can also inspect affected tests. Specialists cannot edit files, approve their own work, or run the validation gate. The orchestrator owns task state, mutation delegation, validation, review reconciliation, approvals, and final user-visible evidence.

Control-plane records use compare-and-swap revisions, atomic local persistence, content hashes, expiring verified knowledge, single-use approvals, ownership receipts, and exclusive workspace leases. High-impact operations and external connector mutations are classified centrally rather than authorized by prompt wording alone.

`run_file_change_hooks` + the automated code-reviewer are the **validation/reviewer gate** that unlocks finalization and commit. Hooks run user-configured checks and, only when a trusted
project explicitly sets `autoFileChangeHooks: true`, combine them with bounded
manifest inference. The opt-in is required because compilers, plugins, build
scripts, and tests can execute repository-controlled code. Inference prefers explicit project scripts and supports native checks for
JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java/Kotlin, .NET, C/C++, Ruby, PHP,
Swift, and Godot. Compiler and linter output is normalized into structured
diagnostics (`file`, range, severity, code, message, command, source) while the
original bounded stdout/stderr remains available for recovery.

- Automated security/test/doc auxiliary agents have explicit lifecycle handling. Their done flags are written only after successful completion; crashes and blocking security verdicts persist as blockers. Test/doc writers run automatically only when the user request explicitly includes those deliverables, and mixed-package test targets are routed to package-specific commands.
- Productive agent steps, subagent duration, file mutations, configured file-change hooks, and terminal commands are all unbounded in wall-clock time by default. The remaining safeguards are user cancellation, cost/token budgets, spawn-depth limits, and context compaction; observational poll bounds (`check_job`, `check_background_agent`) and network/lock timeouts are unchanged. Gate repair and reviewer/specialist no-verdict retries are unlimited by default (finite caps only via `OPENBUFF_MAX_*` env or `createBase2` options); reviewer crashes retry once, and repeated no-verdict outputs keep re-prompting the reviewer instead of parking. Repeated reviewer crashes require the explicit user phrase `bypass reviewer gate` before finalization can continue.
- Root-orchestrator mutating/control gate operations such as Git-status observation, file-change hooks, and structural inventory are model-hidden programmatic tools. Their results are injected when needed after edits, so the harness remains active without paying for those schemas on every provider request. The orchestrator must **not** treat basher typechecks or `run_targeted_validation` as gate substitutes — only the runtime-owned hooks→reviewer cycle clears the gate. The read-only `get_change_review_bundle` tool remains model-visible so an orchestrator can refresh a stale reviewer snapshot after compaction. Fresh greetings and simple gratitude prompts take a narrow conversational fast path only when no pending work or reviewer blocker exists.

**Pattern-specific agents** are intentionally **excluded** from `spawnableAgents` because they have a narrow contract that only makes sense within a specific workflow pattern. They are spawned by the pattern flow itself, not by the orchestrator:

- **`synthesizer`** — the "reduce" half of the [`audit-codebase`](../agents/patterns/audit-codebase.md) map-reduce pattern. It reads ONLY finding files from a scratchpad directory (`.agents/sessions/<slug>/findings/*.md`) and produces a single cross-cutting audit report. It never reads raw source, has `includeMessageHistory: false`, and uses `outputMode: 'structured_output'`. Spawning it outside the audit pattern would be a misuse: it lacks source-reading tools (no `code_search`, `read_outline`, `query_index`, etc.) and its prompt is scoped to a findings directory, so it cannot perform general review or analysis tasks. The `audit-codebase` pattern spawns it directly in Step 4 (Synthesize) after all shard auditors have written their findings to disk.

The distinction matters because adding a pattern-specific agent to `spawnableAgents` would let the orchestrator spawn it in contexts where its contract doesn't apply, producing confusing or empty results. If you add a new pattern-specific agent, follow the same convention: copy the shipped `openbuff.d.example/routes.json` into your project's `openbuff.d/routes.json` and register it there so the pattern can route it, but leave it out of `base2`/`base-deep` `spawnableAgents`.

### Model Routing and Configuration

Because Openbuff does not rely on a hosted model registry or credit-balance router, all agent routing is configured directly in your local configuration (`openbuff.json`, the only config file read; no `codebuff.json` fallback). Under [Local BYOK Mode](./local-mode.md), you map individual agents (e.g., `thinker`, `code-reviewer`, or custom agents) to specific providers and models.

### 3D asset workflow

The harness keeps supported 3D files visible in the live project tree as
metadata-only nodes. This means `glob`, engine detection, and index search can
find `.blend`, `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.dae`, `.3ds`, `.stl`, `.ply`,
and USD-family files without decoding binary payloads as source text.

- `inspect_3d_asset` returns a source hash plus structured scene metadata.
  glTF, GLB, and OBJ have built-in parsers; formats requiring Blender use a
  fixed headless inspection script with blend-file auto-execution disabled and
  never accept model-provided Python. A
  hash-keyed derived summary is cached under `.openbuff/artifacts/3d/metadata/`;
  later index refreshes fold its object/material/camera concepts into the
  source asset's graph node.
- `render_3d_preview` renders deterministic material, clay, or wireframe views
  under `.openbuff/artifacts/3d/`, attaches the PNGs directly, and returns
  receipts binding every artifact hash to its source hash.
- `edit_3d_asset` accepts only bounded declarative operations. It requires the
  inspection source hash, edits a project-scoped working copy, reopens the
  result for validation, and conditionally commits only if the original bytes
  are unchanged. The first supported mutation format is `.blend`.

`inspect_environment` reports whether the local Blender CLI is available.
Blender-backed operations fail closed when it is absent. The built-in glTF,
GLB, and OBJ inspectors do not require Blender.

### Shared Prompt Sections

Several shipped agents share prompt text through centralized sections rather than maintaining separate copies:

- `agents/base2/quality-prompt-section.ts` exports the shared Code Craftsmanship guidance used by `base2`, `base-deep`, and the `editor` agent. This section is byte-frozen by snapshot tests so the three consumers do not drift accidentally.
- The same file also exports `buildBroadAuditSection(finalizeClause)`, which injects the orchestrator's scope-then-shard contract for broad, open-ended, and audit-style requests. The generated section tells `base2` / `base-deep` to measure repository breadth before synthesis, cover frontend/page/route/UI wiring when a frontend exists, spawn file-picker discovery shards by subsystem, add general-agent reasoning/audit shards that can write durable findings files for whole-codebase or production-readiness audits, use thinker for post-discovery synthesis when useful, and interpolate `finalizeClause` for the current prompt path.
- The same file also exports orchestrator-only guidance for gate awareness, security-sensitive file review, and git discipline. `base2` and `base-deep` interpolate those sections; the `editor` intentionally does not, because validation/review, security triage, and git workflow orchestration remain parent-agent responsibilities.
- `common/src/constants/prompt-sections.ts` owns the shared Frontend Development section. `packages/agent-runtime/src/templates/types.ts` exposes it as the `{CODEBUFF_FRONTEND_SECTION}` placeholder, and `packages/agent-runtime/src/templates/strings.ts` replaces that placeholder only when `fileTreeHasFrontendFiles` detects `.tsx` or `.jsx` files in the project tree.
- `common/src/util/language-capabilities.ts` is the canonical registry for TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#/.NET, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, and GDScript. It owns extensions, manifests, bundled idioms, language-server/compiler/formatter/linter/test metadata, and focused/project validation stages. `common/src/util/language-profiles.ts` derives `{CODEBUFF_LANGUAGE_PROFILE}` detection from that registry.
  - Guidance is self-contained and bundled with Openbuff; agents no longer attempt to read `agents/idioms/*` from the user's repository.
  - Explicit target paths and task-language signals take precedence over repository-wide detection, limiting prompt noise in polyglot repositories. The whole file tree remains the fallback when no focused signal exists.
  - The same scoped language profile is available to the orchestrator, editor, test writer, and reviewer.
  - GDScript is detected via `.gd` source files (extension is case-normalized, so `.GD` also matches) and the `project.godot` manifest (exact filename match, case-sensitive). The idiom file is `agents/idioms/gdscript.md`.
  - Public inputs are file-tree nodes (`FileTreeNode[]`) or an explicit `LanguageProfile[]`; public outputs are stable-order `LanguageProfile` objects or a Markdown prompt string. No supported languages detected returns an empty string.
  - Detection uses source extensions plus common manifests. Source extensions are case-normalized; manifest names are matched exactly (for example, `Package.swift` is Swift, while differently-cased manifest names are not treated as manifests).
  - The rendered prompt lists detected display names plus compact bundled idiom guidance, while explicitly preferring more-specific repository compiler, framework, formatter, linter, and test conventions.
  - Example output shape:

    ```md
    ## Language profile

    Detected: Rust. Prefer repository-local compiler, framework, API, formatter, linter, and test conventions when they are more specific than this bundled guidance.

    - Rust: Respect ownership and borrowing, return Result/Option idiomatically, and keep error handling explicit and precise. Let ownership and borrowing drive the design; clone only when the cost and intent are clear.
    ```

- `common/src/util/engine-profiles.ts` owns the engine profile detection layer. It is wired into the same `{CODEBUFF_LANGUAGE_PROFILE}` placeholder alongside the language profile: `strings.ts` concatenates `formatLanguageProfilePromptForFileTree(fileTree)` and `formatEngineProfilePromptForFileTree(fileTree)`, so agents receive both language and engine guidance in a single section. No game engine detected returns an empty string (no engine section is rendered).
  - Public inputs are file-tree nodes (`FileTreeNode[]`); public outputs are stable-order `EngineProfile` objects or a Markdown prompt string. The exported API mirrors `language-profiles.ts`: `detectEngineProfiles(fileTree)`, `formatEngineProfilePrompt({ profiles })`, and `formatEngineProfilePromptForFileTree(fileTree)`.
  - Detection signals per engine:
    - **Unity**: `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` manifest, `.unity`/`.prefab`/`.asmdef` file extensions, `Assets/` or `ProjectSettings/` directory patterns.
    - **Godot**: `project.godot` manifest, `.tscn`/`.tres`/`.gd` file extensions, `addons/` directory pattern.
    - **Unreal Engine**: `.uproject`/`.uasset`/`.umap` file extensions, `Content/` or `Config/` directory patterns.
    - **Bevy**: `Cargo.toml` + `assets/` directory heuristic (conservative — any Rust project with an `assets/` directory will match; a true `bevy` dependency check requires file content not available from the file tree alone).
  - Detection priority: manifest files (exact path match) → file extensions (suffix match) → directory patterns (path prefix match). `.csproj` and `.rs` are intentionally excluded from standalone engine signals to avoid false positives on non-game C#/Rust projects.
  - Stable engine order: `unity`, `godot`, `unreal`, `bevy`.
  - Example output shape:

    ```md
    ## Engine profile

    Detected: Unity. This appears to be a game-engine project. Follow engine-specific conventions for assets, scenes, and build workflows.

    - Unity: Treat Unity assets (scenes, prefabs, ScriptableObjects) as first-class project files. GUID references in .meta files link assets; preserve them when moving or renaming. Avoid reading large binary assets (.png, .fbx, .prefab binary sections) as text — use path/metadata instead.
    ```

  - Gotcha: directory patterns are stored with trailing slashes (e.g. `Assets/`) but the matcher strips the trailing slash internally, so `Assets/` matches `Assets/Scripts/Player.cs` without doubling the separator.

- The `editor` prompt includes Code Craftsmanship plus the conditional language and frontend placeholders, so implementation agents get the same style guidance as the orchestrator without inheriting the parent system prompt.

### Researcher-web agent contract

The shipped `researcher-web` agent is the web-search specialist spawned
during the discovery phase. Its input schema accepts a `prompt` plus optional
depth, locale, preferred-domain, and date-range controls. The agent runs a programmatic `handleSteps` generator that
automatically routes between two modes depending on the prompt:

- **Simple (single-query) path** — for short, focused prompts (< 60
  chars, one question, no list structure). Makes one `web_search` call
  with the prompt as the query and returns the result directly. Matches
  the original fast-path behavior.
- **Broad decomposition path** — for broad, multi-part prompts.
  The prompt is first stripped of meta-instructions ("search the web
  for", "find information about", etc.), then decomposed into focused
  subquestions. If decomposition yields 2 or more subquestions, each is
  searched iteratively (max 3 total `web_search` calls). Each
  subquestion is trimmed to a concise search query by stripping
  question-words ("what is", "how does", etc.) and trailing
  punctuation, capped at 120 characters.
  If decomposition yields fewer than 2 subquestions, the prompt falls
  through to the simple single-query path.

The decomposition uses four strategies in priority order:
numbered items → question-mark sentences → bullet markers →
comparison topic extraction. The first strategy that yields 2+
subquestions wins.

**Retry on empty results:** when a subquestion search returns no
results, the query is retried with a shorter keyword-based version.
Failed subquestions are included in the final report with their error
message.

**Output format:** every path returns structured output. Each question records
`answered`, `failed`, or `skipped`, its answer, and citations tied to that
question. A deduplicated source list and explicit `skippedQuestions` array make
bounded-call omissions visible to the parent agent.

Gotchas: the decomposer uses heuristic regex, not an LLM, so unusual
prompt structures may stay on the simple path. The max-call bounds (5
subquestions, 3 total calls) prevent unbounded search loops. URL
prompts ("fetch this page") use the unchanged URL-fetch path regardless
of prompt breadth.

### Test-writer agent contract

The shipped `test-writer` agent is the coverage specialist used by the
orchestrator and by explicit subagent calls. Its input schema accepts an
optional `params.target_files` array and an optional `params.test_command`.
When `target_files` is present, the agent reads those source files before
writing tests so it can match the changed public surface and edge cases.
It mutates only through `edit_transaction` (with `str_replace` / `create` /
`write_file` as edit _types_ inside the transaction, not as standalone tools),
plus read/outline tools. It does **not** run terminal commands itself. If
`test_command` is provided, the agent reports that command back for the parent
or `basher` to run during validation.

Model-visible `edit_transaction` payload shape (tool name `edit_transaction`):

```json
{
  "edits": [
    {
      "type": "str_replace",
      "path": "packages/foo/__tests__/bar.test.ts",
      "replacements": [
        {
          "oldString": "describe('bar', () => {",
          "newString": "describe('bar', () => {\n  test('handles empty input', () => {\n    expect(bar('')).toBe(null)\n  })"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "create",
      "path": "packages/foo/__tests__/baz.test.ts",
      "content": "import { describe, expect, test } from 'bun:test'\n\ndescribe('baz', () => {\n  test('works', () => {\n    expect(true).toBe(true)\n  })\n})\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent's prompt contract is narrow: read the changed source, find an
existing test in the same package, mimic that harness and assertion style,
write focused behavior-oriented tests, and stop rather than modifying the
source under test if it discovers a product bug. Its final response should
name the test files changed and state whether validation is parent-owned,
not run by `test-writer`, or skipped because no command was supplied.

### CLI Agent/Tool Block Rendering

The CLI renders nested agent activity as a hierarchy of content blocks:
`AgentBranchWrapper` owns each agent card, `AgentBlockGrid` lays sibling
agents into responsive groups, and `AgentBranchItem` provides the
collapsible bordered card with status, prompt, preview text, and expanded
children. Agent cards compute their own streaming state from the chat
store, wrap prompts/previews to the available column width, and pass a
reduced body width to nested markdown, tool, thinking, and child-agent
renderers so long paths and command output stay inside the card.

Inside an agent card, `processBlocks` routes grouped content to specialized
renderers: `ThinkingBlock` collapses reasoning text through the shared
`Thinking` component, `ToolBlockGroup` renders consecutive tool calls,
and nested agent groups recurse through `AgentBlockGrid`. Tool rendering
uses `ToolBranch`: hidden tools such as `end_turn`, `ask_user`, and blocks
with `includeToolCall === false` are skipped; registered tool components
render their custom content; unregistered tools fall back to `ToolCallItem`
with JSON input, optional result output, streaming previews, finished
previews, and default collapsed state.

`Thinking` normalizes reasoning text for compact previews, shows the last
few visual lines while collapsed, preserves original line breaks in the
expanded view, and uses explicit available-width calculations instead of
terminal-wide defaults when embedded inside an agent card. `ToolCallItem`
uses display-cell widths for toggle indentation and wraps collapsed and
expanded content separately, so bullets, disclosure arrows, dense mode,
and nested code blocks align predictably in narrow terminal layouts.

#### Plan blocks and execution affordance

Durable plan execution uses versioned `STATE.json` state. Schema version 2
adds execution phases (`draft`, `ready`, `executing`, `validating`,
`reviewing`, `blocked`, `paused`, and terminal states), a monotonic revision
for compare-and-swap updates, and validation/review checkpoint evidence.
Executable PLAN.md checklist items should use this canonical syntax:

```md
- [ ] P6.3 Task title
  - Depends on: P6.2
  - Acceptance: observable completion condition
  - Validate: bun test path/to/test.ts
```

The stable ID is the first visible token after the checkbox. The parser also
accepts existing safe variants (`**P6.3**`, `[P6.3]`, legacy hyphen IDs such as
`P1-T1`, and an optional `<!-- task-id: P6.3 -->` annotation), so an existing
PLAN.md does not need a duplicate execution ledger or a whole-file rewrite.
ID-less prose checkboxes are intentionally ignored as non-executable items.
Resume prompts include a deterministic preflight summary that reports zero
tasks, malformed or duplicate IDs, dependency errors, and malformed execution
fields, then identifies the next dependency-ready task.

`update_plan_status` accepts `taskId` for exact task targeting (legacy
substring `task` matching remains compatible), `expectedRevision` to reject
stale writers, and `checkpoint` to persist validation/review evidence. Execute
Plan should keep at most one task in progress and only mark it done after its
validation gate passes.

The CLI treats a complete `<PLAN>...</PLAN>` response as a structured plan
block instead of ordinary prose. `extractPlanFromBuffer(buffer)` returns
the trimmed text between the exact uppercase tags, and `insertPlanBlock`
appends that text as a `PlanContentBlock` after scrubbing the raw plan tags
from neighboring text blocks.

Public block shape:

```ts
type PlanContentBlock = {
  type: 'plan'
  content: string
  metadata?: PlanArtifactMetadata
}

type PlanArtifactMetadata = {
  sessionPath?: string
  specPath?: string
  planPath?: string
  statusPath?: string
  lessonsPath?: string
  customArtifacts?: Array<{ label: string; path: string }>
  customArtifactCommands?: string[]
  executeCommand?: string
  resumeCommand?: string
  updateCommand?: string
  statusCommand?: string
  lessonsCommand?: string
}
```

`PlanBox` renders `content` as Markdown, renders an `Artifacts` section
when metadata is present, and shows an `Execute Plan` button. The button
uses the chat input build-fast handler: it switches the current mode to
`EXECUTE_PLAN`, submits the prompt `Build it!`, then clears the input. On
extra-narrow terminal widths the helper text above the button is hidden;
the button remains visible.

In addition to the `Execute Plan` button, all plan commands (execute,
resume, update, status, lessons, and custom artifact commands) render as
**clickable buttons** with per-command hover highlighting. Clicking a
command button calls the `onInsertCommand` callback, which inserts the
command string into the chat input bar with the cursor at the end and
focuses the input — it does **not** auto-submit. The user can then hit
Enter to submit the command or edit the text first. This is distinct from
the `Execute Plan` button's `onBuildFast` handler, which auto-submits in
`EXECUTE_PLAN` mode.

Known artifact paths (Session, SPEC/PLAN/STATUS/LESSONS.md) and custom
artifact entries render as static `label: path` text rows (not clickable),
so users can read which files the plan created without accidentally
inserting their paths into the input.

The `onInsertCommand` callback is threaded through the component chain
via the `MessageBlockStore` Zustand store:

1. `Chat` (`cli/src/chat.tsx`) defines `handleInsertCommand(command)` and
   registers it on the store via `setMessageBlockCallbacks`.
2. `useMessageBlockStore` (`cli/src/state/message-block-store.ts`) holds
   it in `MessageBlockCallbacks.onInsertCommand` alongside the other
   stable callbacks (`onToggleCollapsed`, `onBuildFast`, `onFeedback`,
   `onEditMessage`). The default is a noop.
3. `MessageWithAgents` reads it from the store and passes it to
   `MessageBlock`.
4. `MessageBlock` → `BlocksRenderer` → `SingleBlock` (for `plan` block
   type) → `PlanBox`.
5. For nested agent blocks, `BlocksRenderer` → `AgentBranchWrapper` →
   `AgentBody` → recursive `AgentBranchWrapper` threads it through the
   agent tree.

`extractPlanMetadata(planContent)` returns `undefined` when no recognized
metadata is present. Otherwise it returns a `PlanArtifactMetadata` object.
Recognized labels are `Session`, `Session Path`, `Session Directory`,
`Session Dir`, `SPEC.md` / `Spec`, `PLAN.md` / `Plan`, `STATUS.md` /
`Status`, and `LESSONS.md` / `Lessons`. Bare `.agents/sessions/...` paths
also infer the session path, and paths ending in `/SPEC.md`, `/PLAN.md`,
`/STATUS.md`, or `/LESSONS.md` fill the matching artifact field.

Unrecognized `Label: value` bullet lines are captured as **custom artifacts**
(`metadata.customArtifacts`, an array of `{ label, path }`) when the value
looks path-like — it contains at least one `/` or ends with `.md`. This lets
plans declare extra artifacts beyond the fixed SPEC/PLAN/STATUS/LESSONS set
(e.g. `- Architecture: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh/architecture.md` or
`- Wireframe: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh/wireframe.png`) and have them
rendered in the `PlanBox` Artifacts section alongside the known artifacts.
The known-label check always takes precedence, so custom artifacts never
override or collide with the fixed fields. Custom artifact capture works
with both bullet (`-`/`*`/`+`) and numbered-list (`1.`/`2.`) prefixes, as
well as bare `Label: value` lines with no prefix. Prose lines whose value
has spaces but no path separators (e.g. `Note: this is important prose`)
are NOT captured. The label keeps its original casing; only markdown
formatting marks (`*_` and leading `#`) are stripped from the label, and
markdown link wrappers (label plus parenthesized path) and trailing
`.`/`,`/`;` are stripped from the path value. An empty `customArtifacts`
array is treated
as empty by `isNonEmptyPlanMetadata`.

When custom artifacts are present, `withPlanCommands` also generates a
`customArtifactCommands` array — one natural-language prompt per custom
artifact. For paths ending in `.md`, the command is `Read <path>`; for all
other file types (`.png`, `.yaml`, etc.), it is `Open <path>`. These are
display-only informational strings rendered in the PlanBox Artifacts section
alongside the known plan commands. Like the known commands, custom artifact
commands render as clickable buttons — clicking inserts the command string
into the chat input without submitting. They are not registered slash
commands. Custom artifact commands are generated even when no session path
is found — the only prerequisite is that `customArtifacts` is non-empty.

When a session or artifact path is found, command fields are generated
with the session target:

```text
/mode:execute_plan Build it!
/resume-plan <session>
/update-plan <session>
/plan-status <session>
/lessons <session>
```

Minimal plan response with artifact metadata:

```md
<PLAN>
# Plan

## Artifacts

- Session: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh
- SPEC.md: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh/SPEC.md
- PLAN.md: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh/PLAN.md
- STATUS.md: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh/STATUS.md
- LESSONS.md: .agents/sessions/auth-refresh/LESSONS.md
  </PLAN>
```

Gotchas:

- `<PLAN>` and `</PLAN>` extraction is case-sensitive.
- `</cb_plan>` is scrubbed from rendered prose for legacy compatibility,
  but it does not make `extractPlanFromBuffer` return plan content.
- Markdown link targets and simple formatting marks are normalized away
  during metadata parsing; trailing `.`, `,`, and `;` are dropped from
  metadata values.
- `isPlanBlock(block)` narrows a content block to `PlanContentBlock` by
  checking `block.type === 'plan'`.

### Shell Shims

You can run individual specialized agents as direct terminal commands without the `openbuff` prefix. This is handled by shell shims:

```bash
openbuff shims install openbuff/base2@1.0.0
eval "$(openbuff shims env)"
base2 "fix this bug"
```

For backward compatibility, the `codebuff` command prefix may still work as a compatibility alias where the shim is installed; prefer `openbuff`.

## Automated phase-gates

> The canonical Gate vs Specialists matrix and Params Contract live in [agents/base2/quality-prompt-section.ts](../agents/base2/quality-prompt-section.ts) (`specialistRoutingSection`) and [agents/guides/specialist-routing.md](../agents/guides/specialist-routing.md) — this doc links there rather than duplicating.

The orchestrator (`base2` / `base-deep`, via the shared `createBase2` generator) runs three automated phase-gates around the existing validation + code-reviewer gate. Each gate is idempotent per pending gate-file set: it fires exactly once for a given set of edited files, and its done-flag resets only when the pending file set changes (order-insensitive). Security-reviewer and specialist credit additionally carry a PHASE-4 per-file, content-keyed ledger (`securityReviewFileMarkers` / `specialistReviewFileMarkers`): re-absorbing the same still-dirty path with UNCHANGED bytes does not re-fire the gate, while a confirmed byte change to an attested file re-fires it as a SCOPED re-review of exactly the drifted subset (legacy serialized state without the marker maps keeps the scalar whole-set fingerprints and their semantics). All three gates are guarded by the `runValidationGate` flag, so `base2-fast` / `base2-fast-no-validation` skip them.

The gate predicates are self-contained string/regex matchers defined inline inside `createBase2.handleSteps`. They intentionally do NOT import `micromatch` or any module-scope binding, because `handleSteps` is serialized via `.toString()` and reconstructed with `new Function(...)`; module-scope imports would be `undefined` at reconstruction time. The glob list mirrors the advisory `securityReviewSection` in `agents/base2/quality-prompt-section.ts` so the automated gate and the advisory prompt agree on what counts as security-sensitive.

The three aux gates all fire BEFORE the validation + code-reviewer gate, in this order: `test-writer` → `doc-writer` → `security-reviewer` → specialists → hooks+`code-reviewer`. After all aux gates complete (or skip via predicate), the existing validation hooks + `code-reviewer` gate run unchanged as the FINAL gate. The orchestrator's loop waits for each aux spawn to complete before proceeding to the next gate, so the orchestrator does not race `test-writer`, `doc-writer`, or `security-reviewer` and does not duplicate their work during finalization.

For the Params Contract (`snapshot_id` vs `snapshot_fingerprint`) and compaction recovery, see [agents/guides/specialist-routing.md](../agents/guides/specialist-routing.md).

1. **`testWriterGate` (pre-reviewer, R1b)** — fires BEFORE the validation/reviewer gate when any pending gate file is a non-test source file in a package with a known test command. Maps file paths to per-package test commands. For each package, the orchestrator runs that package's own `typecheck` and `test` scripts (for example, in `packages/agent-runtime`, `packages/internal`, `common`, `agents`, or `cli`). Files under `__tests__/`, `*.test.ts(x)`, `*.spec.ts(x)`, `*.generated.*`, docs/JSON/YAML/TOML, `.env*`, `docs/`, `evals/`, and `.agents/` are excluded. Spawns `test-writer` with the target files and the inferred `test_command`.
2. **`docWriterGate` (pre-reviewer, R1c)** — fires BEFORE the validation/reviewer gate when any pending gate file is a public-API source file: `packages/<name>/src/`, `agents/` (non-test), `common/src/`, or `cli/src/`. Spawns `doc-writer` with the source files and `docs/agents-and-tools.md` as the default target doc.
3. **`securityReviewerGate` (pre-reviewer, R1a)** — fires BEFORE the validation/reviewer gate when any pending gate file matches a security-sensitive pattern: `.env*` files; basenames containing `secret`, `token`, or `apikey`; or any path segment equal to `auth`, `oauth`, `credentials`, `session`, `crypto`, `keys`, `secrets`, `vault`, `billing`, `payment`, `stripe`, `permissions`, `rbac`, or `policy`. Spawns `security-reviewer` with the changed files. The orchestrator waits for `security-reviewer` to finish before proceeding to the final code-reviewer gate.

Each aux gate is predicate-gated: if no pending file matches its relevance predicate (non-test source with a package test command for `test-writer`, public-API source for `doc-writer`, security-sensitive path for `security-reviewer`), it skips silently. The three predicates overlap on common package source paths (`packages/<name>/src/`, `agents/` non-test, `common/src/`, `cli/src/` are all both non-test source and public-API source), so a single edited file in one of those directories typically fires both `test-writer` and `doc-writer`. For example, a `cli/src/components/*.tsx` change fires `test-writer` (the `cli` package test command resolves) and `doc-writer` (`cli/src/` is a public-API source path), and skips `security-reviewer` (no security-sensitive glob). Only files outside all three predicates — e.g. a `docs/*.md` edit or a `*.generated.ts` file — skip every aux gate; the final `code-reviewer` gate runs unconditionally on the full set of edited files regardless.

The three done-flags (`testWriterGateDone`, `docWriterGateDone`, `preEditSecurityReviewDone`) and the `auxGatesLastPendingFiles` snapshot live on `Base2ActiveWorkState` (`agents/base2/gate-state.ts`). `detectPendingGateFileSetChange` + `resetAuxGateFlags` reset the flags when the pending file set changes (compared via `gateFileSetsEqual`, order-insensitive). The reset predicate compares the AUX-RELEVANT subset of pending files — files that at least one aux predicate would act on — so newly-written aux outputs (test files created by `test-writer`, doc files updated by `doc-writer`) do not perturb the snapshot and do not re-trigger the aux gates for the same pending file set.

PHASE 4 also makes reviewer-family credit content-keyed per file. On a security or specialist pass the gate stores `readGateFileContentMarker` hashes for exactly the attested files (`securityReviewFileMarkers`, `specialistReviewFileMarkers[agentType]`); a later encounter re-reviews only the files whose markers no longer match the live bytes, merging fresh markers on pass so credit for unchanged files survives. Marker eviction in the changed-files ledger is content-aware: only confirmed byte drift drops a file's security credit, so the per-iteration git-status re-absorption of an unchanged dirty path cannot loop security-reviewer. The validation side mirrors this: the newest full-assurance `validationEvidence` entry carries `fileMarkers`, and when it covers exactly the current gate-scope set with every marker still matching, the hook run is skipped and the receipt is reused verbatim (any reduced-assurance summary, legacy entry without markers, or marker mismatch falls through to a fresh hook run).

## Concurrent gate isolation (`selfMutatedPaths`)

Mid-turn git-status absorption must not claim foreign worktree dirt from concurrent Openbuff instances or external editors. Terminal steps no longer auto-absorb every newly dirty path; basher/codegen writes re-enter the validation/reviewer gate only through published ownership. `touchedPaths` is best-effort ownership attribution for that absorb path, not authorization to mutate or finalize.

### Absorb rule (`shouldAbsorbGitStatusFile`)

`shouldAbsorbGitStatusFile` credits a dirty path only when all of the following hold:

- it was **not** dirty at turn start (`initialGitStatusFiles`)
- it is **not** already gate-passed (`gatePassedFiles`)
- it is task-related (`changedFiles` / `taskRelatedFiles`) **or** listed in `selfMutatedPaths`

The pure helper lives in `agents/base2/gate-concurrency.ts`. The inline copy is generated via `scripts/generate-gate-helpers.ts` from `gate-concurrency.ts` into the `<gate-helpers-generated>` marker region of `createBase2.handleSteps` (serialized via `.toString()` / `new Function(...)`). Freshness is enforced by `agents/__tests__/gate-helpers-freshness.test.ts` and by `prebuild:agents` regenerating the region.

### Explicit Git-delivery adoption is reviewable-scoped

A turn with explicit Git-delivery intent (`commit`/`push`/`stage` the changes — the
only turn type that claims files already dirty at turn start) adopts turn-start
worktree dirt into the gate through **reviewable files only**. The delivery path
runs `selectReviewableGateFiles(initialGitStatusFiles)` instead of absorbing the
full dirty worktree, so non-reviewable dirt (docs, session `STATE.json`, `.jsonl`,
config) that belongs to the worktree or other tabs never enters `pendingGateFiles`
and is never pushed onto the reviewer's attestation list. Reviewable source/test
files the delivery is committing still enter the gate. This mirrors the general
mid-turn absorb rule above and keeps a clean `"commit our changes"` turn from
turning into a worktree-wide review. Regression coverage:
`agents/e2e/reviewer-spawn-conditions.e2e.test.ts`.

### `AgentState.selfMutatedPaths`

Optional JSON-safe `string[]` on `AgentState` in `common/src/types/session-state.ts`. The runtime publishes it after each stream step so mid-turn absorption can credit process-owned writes without sweeping the whole dirty tree.

### Publisher (`publishSelfMutatedPaths`)

`publishSelfMutatedPaths` in `packages/agent-runtime/src/run-agent-step.ts` runs after `processStream` and merges into `agentState.selfMutatedPaths`. Sources (normalized project-relative paths):

- confirmed `file_mutation_result` applied actions (including move destinations)
- schemaVersion=1 agent receipts and nested `changedFiles`
- optional `touchedPaths` on SYNC terminal results and on the first settled `check_job` result

### SYNC `run_terminal_command` `touchedPaths`

SYNC commands take a pre/post `git status --porcelain -uall` dirty delta and may attach optional `touchedPaths` on the command result (project-relative; omits pre-existing dirt). Soft-fail omits the field outside a git repo or when git fails. Helpers: `listDirtyPaths` / `dirtyDelta` / `withTouchedPaths` in `sdk/src/tools/run-terminal-command.ts`. Schema: optional `touchedPaths` on SYNC success and timeout/spawn-failure shapes in `common/src/tools/params/tool/run-terminal-command.ts`.

### BACKGROUND settlement `touchedPaths`

BACKGROUND start is fire-and-forget: it stores `dirtyBeforePaths` + `projectRoot` on the in-memory job and does **not** emit `touchedPaths` while the job is running (start result is `jobId`-only). Live `job_update` events drive the user-facing terminal card (output + lifecycle). `check_job` is the agent-side join/follow path for readiness/exitCode; the first settled `check_job` success observation may include one-shot `touchedPaths` (settlement dirty delta); later polls omit the field. Soft-fail when the job was recovered without a snapshot, or outside git / on git failure — settlement is locked so re-polls do not re-attribute post-settle dirt. Schema: optional `touchedPaths` on `check_job` success output in `common/src/tools/params/tool/check-job.ts`.

## Reviewer verdict contract

Shipped reviewers use a structured, versioned verdict. Code-reviewer reports
the reviewed snapshot fingerprint and files, separate correctness/security/
tests/API-compatibility/performance dimensions, requirement coverage with
evidence, findings, and test-coverage classification. **In-scope** missing or
uncertain requirements, a blocked dimension, or missing behavior coverage block
finalization regardless of the overall verdict. Security-reviewer similarly
reports input-boundary, authorization, secret-handling, resource-safety, and
fail-closed dimensions. Legacy label and compact-JSON parsing remains as a
compatibility fallback for custom reviewers.

For schema-version 1 results, the runtime verifies `snapshotFingerprint`
against the pending working-tree snapshot and requires `reviewedFiles` to
include every pending file. Review guidance also covers meaningful test
assertions, public and persisted compatibility, package boundaries,
generated-artifact freshness, migration safety, and bounded resource use.

The `code-reviewer` gate decides whether a turn may finish green. **Only structured `verdict === 'LOOKS_GOOD'` permits gate pass / finalization** (after coverage and requirement adequacy checks). `NON_BLOCKING` does **not** finalize: its findings are collected as open repair targets and enter the same repair-editor / test-writer re-review loop used for `BLOCKING`. Both BLOCKING and NON_BLOCKING rounds increment the reviewer repair counter for telemetry. Repair loops default to **unlimited / progress-gated** (no-progress fingerprint and incomplete-receipt exits); optional hard caps remain via `maxReviewerRepairRounds` / `OPENBUFF_MAX_REVIEWER_REPAIR_ROUNDS` (max `20`). Validation-hook and specialist repair loops are likewise unlimited by default, with optional caps via `maxRepairRounds` / `maxSpecialistRepairRounds` and envs `OPENBUFF_MAX_REPAIR_ROUNDS` / `OPENBUFF_MAX_SPECIALIST_REPAIR_ROUNDS` (max `20`). Already-credited (`gatePassedFiles`) dirty task files stay out of gate scope so they do not re-arm validation/review while remaining dirty for commit UX, and reviewer prompts list files already attested `LOOKS_GOOD` in earlier rounds (with an unchanged-bytes marker where the recorded fingerprint still matches) so review depth concentrates on unattested or drifted files without suppressing fresh findings. Coverage-missing and **in-scope** incomplete requirements still hard-block. The orchestrator parses the reviewer's tool result to extract a finalization verdict (`LOOKS_GOOD` or empty string `''`) and to surface any repair findings. The parser prefers structured (parsed-object) verdicts over text-mode fallbacks. The parsing helpers live in `agents/base2/gate-reviewer.ts` and are mirrored inline inside `createBase2.handleSteps` (the mirror is parity-tested by `agents/__tests__/gate-reviewer.test.ts`).

### Parent-owned / process requirements

Source and specialist reviewers score only **in-scope implementation**
requirements in `requirementCoverage`. Parent/orchestrator process work is out
of scope for those reviewers, including duties such as:

- rewriting or amending git commit messages
- running the full validation gate
- commit and push
- confirming CI/CD is green
- similar "parent must" / operator-only process steps

Canonical helpers live in `agents/base2/gate-reviewer.ts`
(`isParentOwnedOrOutOfScopeRequirement`,
`collectParentOwnedRequirementBlockers`,
`buildSpecialistScopedReviewPrompt`, etc.). They skip elevating parent-owned
missing/uncertain rows to review-finding blockers and still allow `LOOKS_GOOD`
finalization when dimensions and behavior coverage pass. Call-site parent-owned
filters call `collectParentOwnedRequirementBlockers(blockers, toolResult)`,
which returns the subset of blockers that are parent-owned only, so structured
`requirementCoverage` evidence is consulted the same way as
`getReviewerFinalizationVerdict` (a gap that is parent-owned only via evidence
must not finalize while still spawning `repair-editor`). When several structured
rows share the same `status` + requirement text, an in-scope row wins over a
parent-owned one, matching the finalization verdict. Specialists receive a
scoped spawn brief (`Requirements (specialist-domain only)`), not the raw user
prompt as a checklist; parent process wording may appear only under non-blocking
parent context. Defense in depth: pure parent-owned RF sets with `LOOKS_GOOD` do
not spawn `repair-editor`. Real in-scope incomplete requirements still
hard-block. Unit coverage lives in `agents/__tests__/gate-reviewer.test.ts` and
the handleSteps credit path in `agents/__tests__/base2.test.ts`; the e2e
regression is in `agents/e2e/gate-aux-ordering.e2e.test.ts`.

The inline base2 mirror is generated from that canonical module — do **not**
hand-edit the `<gate-helpers-generated>` region in `agents/base2/base2.ts`.
`scripts/generate-gate-helpers.ts` is the single source of truth: it reads
`agents/base2/gate-paths.ts`, `agents/base2/gate-reviewer.ts`,
`agents/base2/gate-repair.ts`, `agents/base2/gate-concurrency.ts`, and
`agents/base2/gate-fingerprint.ts`, strips their `export` modifiers, and emits a
deterministic block into the marker region. Refresh with
`bun run scripts/generate-gate-helpers.ts --write agents/base2/base2.ts` (the
`prebuild:agents` script in `cli/package.json` does this automatically) or
`--check` to fail when stale; `agents/__tests__/gate-helpers-freshness.test.ts`
enforces the same freshness check in CI.

The same pattern covers the context-pruner budget constants. `handleSteps` in
`agents/context-pruner.ts` cannot import
`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/context-pruning.ts` at runtime, so its
`SEMANTIC_*` / `MODEL_CONTEXT_*` literals live in a generated
`<pruner-budgets-generated>` marker region emitted by
`scripts/generate-pruner-budgets.ts`. That script parses the canonical module
with the TypeScript compiler API and copies each exported numeric literal under
its pruner-local name, so the mirror is structural rather than hand-maintained:
change the canonical constants, then run
`bun run scripts/generate-pruner-budgets.ts --write agents/context-pruner.ts`
(also wired into `prebuild:agents`) or `--check` to fail when stale.
`agents/__tests__/pruner-budgets-freshness.test.ts` enforces both the stale-region
check and per-constant parity against the canonical exports. `EXPLICIT_LIMIT_TARGET_FRACTION`
is pruner-local and deliberately sits outside the region.

A reviewer may emit its verdict in either text mode or structured (JSON) mode:

- **Text mode** — the first visible token of the reply is a verdict label followed by `:` (the orchestrator strips any leading `` block first):
  - `LOOKS_GOOD:` → permits finalization when structured output agrees.
  - `NON_BLOCKING:` → reopens repair/re-review until LOOKS_GOOD; findings are repair fuel.
  - `BLOCKING:` → reopens the turn; the labels are surfaced to the orchestrator as `BLOCKING: <finding>` entries.
- **Structured (JSON) mode** — a single JSON object with a `verdict` field (`"LOOKS_GOOD"`, `"NON_BLOCKING"`, or `"BLOCKING"`, case-insensitive, trimmed), an optional `findings` array (or string) of human-readable findings, and an optional `coverage` field (`"covered"`, `"missing"`, or `"n/a"`, case-insensitive). Reviewers may still emit `NON_BLOCKING` for audit; it does not unlock finalization.

```json
{"verdict":"LOOKS_GOOD","findings":[],"coverage":"covered"}
{"verdict":"NON_BLOCKING","findings":["minor naming nit"],"coverage":"covered"}
{"verdict":"BLOCKING","findings":["unhandled null case in parseFoo"],"coverage":"covered"}
```

### Embedded JSON verdict fallback

When a reviewer emits a short prose preamble before its JSON verdict object (e.g. "I now have full context. … {"verdict":"LOOKS_GOOD",…}"), the structured (parsed-object) path only sees parsed JSON nodes, so a verdict embedded in a plain string is invisible to it. The text-mode fallback scans the raw reply text for an embedded `{"verdict"…}` object and honors it as a finalization verdict.

Behavior of the embedded-verdict scanner:

- Finds every `{"verdict"` opener and spans to its matching closing `}`, tracking brace depth with respect for `\"` escapes and JSON string boundaries (a `}` inside a JSON string value does not prematurely close the object).
- Uses the **last** embedded verdict if multiple appear, so a reviewer that echoes a prior `BLOCKING` before a final `LOOKS_GOOD` yields the final `LOOKS_GOOD`.
- A truncated object (opener with no matching `}`) yields no verdict (`''`), so a malformed reviewer reply is treated as no-verdict (re-prompt for format) rather than silently finalized.
- Parses the captured object with `JSON.parse`; an unknown `verdict` value (not one of the three known labels) is rejected as a finalization verdict, matching the structured and line-verdict paths.

### Coverage-adequacy contract

`coverage: "missing"` is **BLOCKING regardless of the text verdict**: a reviewer that emits `{"verdict":"LOOKS_GOOD","coverage":"missing"}` does NOT permit finalization. The orchestrator surfaces this as `BLOCKING: test coverage missing for changed behavior (add a case to the relevant *.test.ts)`. This enforces the shared expectation that behavior-changing edits add a corresponding test case.

### Crash vs. no-verdict

`detectReviewerCrash` distinguishes a reviewer-agent crash from a reviewer that ran but emitted no recognizable verdict:

- **Crash** — any object in the tool-result tree carrying an `errorMessage` string or `type === 'error'`. The message is surfaced verbatim; the orchestrator reports the reviewer crashed and the verdict cannot be trusted.
- **No-verdict** — the reviewer replied without a recognizable verdict label or JSON object. The orchestrator re-prompts for format rather than treating the reply as a crash.

The crash heuristic is depth-capped at 8 levels and will also classify an unrelated nested `errorMessage` (e.g. a failed inner tool call the reviewer made) as a reviewer-agent crash when the reviewer also produced no recognizable verdict; a reviewer whose inner tool call errored AND who produced no verdict is effectively crashed from the operator's perspective.

## Tools

Tools represent the capabilities given to agents to interact with your system.

- Tool schemas and validators live in `common/src/tools` as Zod definitions.
- Tool executions are handled securely by the SDK on your local machine (reading/writing files, executing commands, searching codebase).
- Since Openbuff has no hosted proxy backend, tool execution is extremely low-latency, and all outputs are processed directly by your locally configured models.

### Tool availability and unavailable-tool errors

Each agent is granted a subset of the global tool registry, not the whole
registry. Calling a tool the agent was not granted is rejected: the runtime
fails closed, changes nothing, and returns a diagnostic instead of executing
the tool.

Codebase search for orchestrator/base agents (`base2` / `base-deep`) and the
`general-agent` discovery/analysis shard uses `code_search` for ripgrep-style
content search and `query_index` for graph/index retrieval. Several patterns
mean several `code_search` calls, which may be issued in parallel in one
message. Ungranted tools still fail closed.

The rejection message names the tools the agent actually has available. When
the attempted name is a real-but-ungranted registry tool, the message says so;
for a likely typo it also suggests a near lexical match ("Did you mean ...").
When you hit this error, pick a tool from the listed available tools, or spawn
an agent that provides the capability (for example, call `code_search` directly
for ripgrep-style content search, one call per pattern). Do not retry the same
unavailable name — the result will not change.

### `suggest_followups` last-action contract

For gate-active agents (`canSuggestFollowups` defined), `suggest_followups` is
the absolute last actionable tool after the user-visible completion summary
(and after optional `git-committer` if committing). Never call it mid-turn and
never before remaining work. After followups, only terminal companions may run:
`suggest_followups`, `end_turn`, `task_completed`.

Native and custom/MCP paths share `getPostSuggestFollowupsBlockReason` in
`packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/tool-executor.ts`. `suggestFollowupsEmitted`
is set on the allow path and cleared at the start of each base2 user turn.
`GATE: PENDING` still rejects `suggest_followups`. Non-gated agents
(`canSuggestFollowups` undefined) are unchanged.

These ordering/gate rejections are agent-facing control-flow diagnostics, not
user errors: the runtime emits them with a concise `userMessage` plus
`autoRecovering: true`, so `handleRuntimeError` in
`cli/src/utils/sdk-event-handlers.ts` returns early and no error banner is
shown to the user, while the full `message` still reaches the model through the
`TOOL_CALL_ERROR` path in `packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/stream-parser.ts`.
The rejection wording states plainly that `suggest_followups` is the FINAL
output of the turn: completion summary first, then `git-committer` if
committing, then `suggest_followups` with nothing after it except
`end_turn`/`task_completed`.

### Background shell jobs (`check_job` / `read_logs` / `kill_job` / `list_jobs`)

Background jobs are unified behind a single `JobRegistry` (in the `common`
package) that is the single source of truth for every background job, whether
it is a shell process started with `run_terminal_command` using `process_type:
BACKGROUND` (tagged `kind: 'process'`) or a background agent started with
`spawn_agents({ background: true })` (tagged `kind: 'agent'`). Every job moves
through one lifecycle state machine: `queued -> running -> stopping ->
{completed | error | stopped | lost | cancelled}`. Starting a shell background
job returns a `jobId` immediately. Four read/manage tools operate on shell
jobs:

- `check_job` polls or follows a job's new output and status, and returns the
  job's `logFile` path in its success output. It returns sequenced output
  events (`{type:'output',data}`) with a per-consumer `nextCursor` (plus
  `truncated`/`dropped` bounds) rather than a job-global read offset, so each
  consumer advances its own cursor. Follow mode (`wait_for` with a bounded
  `timeout_seconds`) waits on that event stream until a readiness/error
  predicate matches. The first settled success observation may also include
  one-shot optional `touchedPaths` for concurrent gate isolation (see
  [Concurrent gate isolation (`selfMutatedPaths`)](#concurrent-gate-isolation-selfmutatedpaths));
  start and later re-polls omit that field.
- `read_logs` reads the trailing lines of a job's log (or an arbitrary file).
- `kill_job` stops a running job (status becomes `stopped`).
- `list_jobs` lists the current run's background jobs — both running and
  recently settled, across BOTH shell (`kind: 'process'`) and background-agent
  (`kind: 'agent'`) jobs — so an agent that lost a `jobId` (for example after
  context compaction) can rediscover them. It takes no agent-supplied input;
  the owner field is runtime-managed and agents must omit it.

Background agents are inspected with `check_background_agent`, which emits
`{type:'agent_chunk',chunkType,data}` events over the same sequenced per-consumer
cursor model.

Settled shell jobs remain checkable within the session/TTL: `check_job`,
`read_logs`, and `kill_job` now work after a job has completed (returning its
final status, exit code, and output) rather than failing once it finishes.
Settled entries are retained in the registry with a `completedAt`
timestamp and swept on a TTL, and `list_jobs` reports them until they are swept.

Ownership is a job attribute enforced inside the registry via
`jobRegistry.assertOwned`: a job owned by another run is rejected as a generic
not-found (unavailable) to preserve live-job isolation. Cross-session recovery
re-attaches to a still-running job via `JobRegistry.restampOwner`, which only
upgrades a placeholder owner to the current run's trusted owner and never
launders an already-owned job (a real owner is never overwritten). A recovered
live process stays `running`; one whose process is gone reconciles to `lost`.

Live job status and output reach the CLI without the agent polling: the run
loop consumes the registry event stream in-process and surfaces live job status
and output to the CLI as additive `job_update` events, so users see progress on
their own. `job_update` is an additive, non-breaking member of the print-mode
event union with shape `{ type:'job_update', jobId, kind:'process'|'agent',
state, sequence, label?, outputDelta?, exitCode?, error? }`. It is owner-scoped:
only the run that owns a job receives its updates.

### `query_index`

`query_index` queries the local codebase graph index. It is intended for retrieval-led context gathering before reading or editing files.

The index tracks file paths, extensions, symbols, imports, markdown headings, documentation concepts, package scripts, CI workflow commands, task-runner files, and graph relationships between files/symbols/imports/calls/headings/concepts. Import/reference extraction covers JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java/Kotlin packages, C/C++ includes, C# namespaces, Ruby requires, PHP namespaces/includes, Swift modules, and GDScript resources. Results are discovery hints: always verify returned files with `read_files` or `read_subtree` before editing.

Supported modes:

- `search` — default ranked file search for a natural-language or keyword `query`.
- `explain` — ranked search plus an `explanation` for why each file matched.
- `neighbors` — graph-adjacent files for a `from` path, or neighbors around files matching `query`.
- `path` — shortest graph path between `from` and `to`, or a graph path inferred from `query` matches.
- `references` — files that reference (import/call) the `from` path, expanding outward from a known symbol or file.
- `commands` — command-discovery search that prioritizes package manifests, CI workflows, task runners, and testing/contributing docs. Cargo, Go, Python, Maven/Gradle, .NET, Composer, SwiftPM, CMake, Ruby, and Godot manifests contribute native validation concepts.

Examples:

```json
{ "query": "authentication flow", "limit": 10 }
{ "query": "editor proposal logic", "mode": "explain", "fileTypes": ["ts"] }
{ "mode": "neighbors", "from": "packages/indexer/src/query.ts", "limit": 8 }
{ "mode": "path", "from": "packages/indexer/src/metadata-indexer.ts", "to": "packages/indexer/src/query.ts" }
{ "query": "broader validation suite", "mode": "commands" }
```

Results may include `relatedFiles`, each with a relationship reason and optional `via` symbol/import/concept. Use those related files to expand context around likely entry points.

The canonical response is `query_index_result` schema version 1. It includes an
immutable index snapshot identity (`snapshotId`, index version, build time, and
the incorporated workspace revision when known), plus `indexedHash` on each
result. Treat that hash as retrieval provenance, not live-file authority: a
later `read_files` result must still be used before editing. Parser coverage,
the last structured build error, stale/refreshing state, and semantic fallback
state are exposed in `status` and rendered by the CLI.

Confirmed SDK mutations feed precise create/update/delete/move path deltas and
the monotonic workspace revision into the index manager. Terminal, custom, and
MCP tools fall back to conservative pathless invalidation because their exact
mutation set is not trustworthy. Age-stale snapshots schedule a refresh
automatically, while queries may continue to serve the labeled last-known-good
snapshot during that refresh.

#### Repo-map comparison helpers

`packages/indexer/src/repo-map.ts` exports package-level helpers for retrieval evaluation and reporting. These helpers are available from the `@codebuff/indexer` entrypoint, but they do not change the default `query_index` search path.

Public helpers:

- `buildRepoMap(index, options)` — renders indexed structural metadata into a deterministic text map and returns both the `map` string and structured `entries`.
- `queryRepoMap(index, query, options)` — scores repo-map entries for a query and returns `QueryIndexResult[]`-shaped results.
- `compareRetrievalStrategies(index, cases)` — runs each case through existing `queryIndex` and repo-map retrieval, then reports pass counts, failures, and mean reciprocal rank for both strategies.
- `formatRetrievalComparisonReport(report)` — renders the comparison report as Markdown.

`RepoMapOptions` accepts `maxFiles`, `maxSymbolsPerFile`, `maxImportsPerFile`, `maxHeadingsPerFile`, and `fileTypes`. `fileTypes` may include values with or without a leading dot and is matched against indexed file extensions. `RetrievalComparisonCase` accepts a `query`, `expectedPaths`, optional `queryOptions` for `queryIndex`, and optional `repoMapOptions` for the repo-map side.

Example:

```ts
import {
  compareRetrievalStrategies,
  formatRetrievalComparisonReport,
} from '@codebuff/indexer'

const report = compareRetrievalStrategies(index, [
  {
    query: 'rust auth session token',
    expectedPaths: ['crates/auth/src/session.rs'],
    repoMapOptions: { fileTypes: ['rs'] },
  },
])

console.log(formatRetrievalComparisonReport(report))
```

Gotchas: repo-map helpers operate on an already-built `MetadataIndex`; they do not read files or rebuild the index. `queryRepoMap` tokenizes the query and returns only positive-score matches, so blank or stop-word-only queries return no results. `buildRepoMap` sorts files by path before applying `maxFiles`, while `queryRepoMap` scores the full candidate set before applying its result limit.

#### Binary file skipping and file-tree truncation

Three independent stages keep binary and oversized files out of the index AND out of the project file tree shown to agents at runtime. Each stage owns its own extension list (no shared import) so there is no cross-package dependency between `common/` and `packages/indexer/`; the lists intentionally overlap but are kept in sync by convention, not by a single source of truth.

**Stage 1 — file-walker (`packages/indexer/src/file-walker.ts`).** `walkProject(projectRoot, extraExclude)` is the filesystem walker that feeds `buildMetadataIndex` / `updateMetadataIndex`. It applies, in order:

- `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_DIRS` — `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.output`, `.turbo`, `coverage`, `.cache`, `.codebuff-index`, `tmp`, `.tmp`, `out`, and others.
- nested `.gitignore`, `.openbuffignore`, and legacy `.codebuffignore`
  patterns, plus the same mandatory sensitive-path policy enforced by file-read
  tools.
- `extraExclude` directory names passed by the caller (the indexer uses this for the cache directory).
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE` — files larger than 500 KB are skipped (never `stat`-hashed).
- `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` — after stat, files whose lowercase extension is in this set are skipped before they are ever hashed or read. The set covers game-engine binary assets (`.uasset`, `.umap`, `.unity`, `.prefab`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.blend`, `.meta`, ...), images/textures, audio, video, 3D/animation, compiled/packaged, compressed archives, and binary containers (`.pdf`, `.sqlite`, `.bin`, ...). See the `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` export in `file-walker.ts` for the full list.
- the configured `maxFiles` limit (20,000 by default). Traversal is sorted and
  status reports partial coverage, skipped counts, and uncovered prefixes when
  the limit is reached.

`walkProject` returns `WalkedFile[]` (`absolutePath`, `relativePath`, `ext`, `mtime`, `size`). `metadata-indexer.ts` imports the same `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` from `./file-walker` and repeats the check inside `indexWalkedFile` as a second line of defense, so files added through a path other than the walker are still dropped before being read as UTF-8.

**Stage 2 — project file tree (`common/src/project-file-tree.ts`).** `getProjectFileTree` builds the tree shown in agent system prompts. It applies `DEFAULT_IGNORED_PATHS` and nested `.gitignore` / `.openbuffignore` rules. It also defines its **own** local `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` Set (not imported from `file-walker.ts`) — this is deliberate, to avoid a cross-package dependency from `common/` → `packages/indexer/`. The two lists overlap intentionally and are kept in sync by convention. Binary files never appear as tree nodes.

**Stage 3 — file-tree truncation (`packages/agent-runtime/src/system-prompt/truncate-file-tree.ts`).** `truncateFileTreeBasedOnTokenBudget` shrinks the already-built tree to a token budget with a 4-level cascade, stopping at the first level that fits:

1. `removeUnimportantFiles` — always applied first. Drops files matching a separate `unimportantExtensions` list (generated/minified JS, `.map`, `.d.ts`, `.pyc`, build output dirs like `/dist/` `/build/` `/node_modules/`, logs, media, game-engine binary assets, binary containers). This is a **third** independent extension list — again deliberately local to avoid a cross-package import. Empty directories after filtering are pruned. The tree is rebuilt immutably so the caller's tree stays pristine for other consumers.
2. `none` — if the token-annotated filtered tree fits the budget, render it as-is.
3. `unimportant-files` — if the no-token filtered tree fits, render it without per-file token scores.
4. `tokens` (`pruneFileTokenScores`) — iteratively strip the lowest-scoring per-file token annotations (batched, with a 5-tokens-per-name estimate) until the annotated tree fits.
5. `depth-based` — if tokens pruning alone is not enough, remove the deepest files first (sorted by depth, sampled to estimate avg tokens per filename, removed in batches of `0.5 × tokensToRemove / avgTokensPerFileName + 100`, capped at 10 iterations). A no-progress safety break stops the loop if token count stops decreasing.

Gotchas:

- There are **three** independent binary/unimportant extension lists: `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` in `file-walker.ts` (used by the walker + `metadata-indexer.ts`), the local `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` in `project-file-tree.ts` (used by the tree builder), and `unimportantExtensions` in `truncate-file-tree.ts` (used by the truncator). They overlap heavily but are not unified; adding a new binary extension means updating all three. The separation is intentional to avoid `common/` → `packages/indexer/` and `packages/agent-runtime/` → `common/` import cycles.
- `.meta`, `.prefab`, and `.unity` (Unity text serialization formats) are intentionally **excluded** from the `BINARY_EXTENSIONS` sets in both `file-walker.ts` and `project-file-tree.ts` so the indexer and file tree include them as text — they are YAML in Unity's text serialization mode and are parsed for asset references (see "Asset reference extraction" below). They **are** included in `truncate-file-tree.ts`'s `unimportantExtensions` list, so they are dropped from the agent-facing system-prompt file tree even though they remain in the indexer's graph. This split is deliberate: the indexer needs them for the asset reference graph; the system prompt does not need them because they are not source files an agent would edit.
- The 500 KB `MAX_FILE_SIZE` and configurable `maxFiles` caps are walk-time
  limits for the indexer only; `truncate-file-tree.ts` has its own token-budget
  limits that are independent of file count. Configuration defaults, semantic
  privacy/cost behavior, lifecycle states, and repair commands are documented
  canonically in [Configuration: Indexing and retrieval](configuration.md#indexing-and-retrieval).
- All extension matching is case-normalized (lowercased before lookup) and is a coarse extension allowlist, not a content sniff. A text file renamed `.bin` is skipped; a binary file with a non-binary extension is caught by the size limit (or by UTF-8 read failure inside `indexWalkedFile`).
- `truncate-file-tree.ts` rebuilds the tree immutably in `removeUnimportantFiles`; it does not mutate the input `fileTree` so other consumers of `ProjectFileContext.fileTree` are unaffected.

#### Asset reference extraction

`packages/indexer/src/asset-refs.ts` extracts lightweight text references from
game engine asset files so the indexer can create `references` edges in the
codebase graph. The extractor is purely text-based — it never reads binary
payloads. Binary formats (`.uasset`, `.umap`, `.fbx`, etc.) are skipped by
`BINARY_EXTENSIONS` before they reach this module.

The public API (exported from `@codebuff/indexer`) includes:

- `extractAssetRefs(content, ext, filePath): AssetRef[]` — dispatch by
  extension to the engine-specific extractor. Returns `[]` for non-asset
  files or unsupported formats.
- `extractGodotScriptRefs(content): AssetRef[]` — extract `preload("res://…")`
  / `load("res://…")` references from `.gd` GDScript files.
- `AssetRef` (type) — `{ rawRef, refType, resolvedPath }`.

Two internal helpers are used by `metadata-indexer.ts` to build the graph
edges and are NOT exported from the package entrypoint:

- `buildGuidToPathMap(files): Map<string, string>` — build a Unity GUID →
  project-relative path map from all indexed `.meta` files. Called inside
  `buildGraph` to resolve GUID refs in `.prefab`/`.unity` files.
- `resolveGuidRef(guid, guidMap): string | null` — resolve a Unity GUID to a
  file path via the map.

`AssetRef.refType` is one of:

| `refType`    | Source format                    | Example raw ref                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `guid`       | Unity `.meta`/`.prefab`/`.unity` | 32-char hex GUID                       |
| `res_path`   | Godot `.tscn`/`.tres`/`.gd`      | `res://textures/player.png`            |
| `asset_path` | Unreal `.uproject`, Bevy configs | `Source/MyModule`, `assets/sprite.png` |
| `file_id`    | Unity `.prefab`/`.unity` (local) | integer `{fileID: 12345}`              |

Per-engine extraction strategy:

- **Unity `.meta`**: extracts the `guid:` field as a self-identifying `guid`
  ref with `resolvedPath` set to the `.meta` file's path with the `.meta`
  suffix stripped (the GUID belongs to this asset). Other files referencing
  this GUID resolve via the GUID → path map in `buildGraph`.
- **Unity `.prefab`/`.unity`** (text serialization): extracts external `guid:`
  references as `guid` refs (resolved later via the GUID → path map) and
  `fileID:` local references as `file_id` refs (always unresolved — they are
  intra-file references, not cross-file).
- **Godot `.tscn`/`.tres`**: extracts `[ext_resource path="res://…"]`
  declarations. `resolvedPath` is the `res://` path with the protocol
  stripped (project-relative).
- **Godot `.gd`** (GDScript): extracts `preload("res://…")` / `load("res://…")`
  calls, creating script→asset edges.
- **Unreal `.uproject`** (JSON): parses `Modules` and `Plugins` arrays, each
  name mapped to `Source/<Name>` or `Plugins/<Name>`.
- **Bevy**: extracts quoted asset paths from `.ron`/`.toml` config files that
  live under an `assets/` directory, resolving to `assets/<path>`.

Graph integration: `metadata-indexer.ts` stores `AssetRef[]` on
`IndexedFile.assetRefs` (only present when non-empty). `buildGraph` uses the
GUID → path map to resolve Unity `guid` refs, then creates `references` edges
from the referencing file to the target asset. If the target asset itself is a
binary file (e.g. `.png`) not in the index, the edge falls back to the
`.meta` sidecar file (which IS indexed as text YAML), so the reference still
connects to a real graph node.

Gotchas:

- Only `.meta`, `.prefab`, `.unity`, `.tscn`, `.tres`, `.gd`, `.uproject`, and
  Bevy `.ron`/`.toml` (under `assets/`) produce asset refs; all other
  extensions return `[]`.
- Up to 80 asset refs per file (`MAX_ASSET_REFS_PER_FILE`), deduplicated by
  `rawRef`, to bound index growth.
- `fileID` refs are always `resolvedPath: null` — they are local references
  within a single serialized file and do not create cross-file edges.

### `read_files`

Tool definitions may provide two input schemas. `inputSchema` is the runtime
compatibility parser and continues accepting complete legacy call shapes from
persisted sessions and external clients. `providerInputSchema`, when present,
is the smaller canonical schema sent to model providers and used to generate
agent TypeScript types. Compatibility aliases therefore do not inflate new
prompts or teach models overlapping call forms.

Every complete whole-file, range, or symbol-slice result exposes one structured
`editAnchor` with `startLine`, `endLine`, `contentHash`, and
`readCapability`. `editAnchor.readCapability` is the copy-ready cap.v3 edit
authority; the bounds and hash are diagnostic metadata and must not be mixed
into the same edit call. Structured results expose no duplicate top-level
`rangeHash` or `readCapability` fields. Partial or truncated file/range items
expose neither hashes nor edit capabilities; successful slices in a partially
satisfied symbol request retain their own anchors.

Model-facing range content omits the transport-only `[RANGE_BLOCK ...]`
metadata header. Exact undecorated bytes remain available as `sourceContent`,
while the structured anchor carries freshness metadata without prose parsing.

For large files, `read_files` is also the capability-minting block reader: the
`windows`, `around`, `symbol`, and batch `symbols` selectors below return one
or more COMPLETE structural blocks so a large file yields a usable edit anchor
without a guess-shrink-retry loop. Every complete block returns a structured
`editAnchor` (`startLine`, `endLine`, `contentHash`, cap.v3 `readCapability`)
that can be copied verbatim to `basedOnRead` / `readCapability` on a follow-up
edit. Partial or failed blocks mint no capability. The selector modes may be
combined in one call:

- `windows: [{ path, windowSize?, window? }]` — split the file into complete
  contiguous line windows (default `windowSize` 400). Omit `window` to get the
  manifest (`totalLines`, `windowSize`, `windowCount`) plus the first window.
- `around: [{ path, match, occurrence?, contextLines? }]` — return a complete
  block around the 1-indexed `occurrence` (default 1) of the exact literal
  `match`, with `contextLines` (default 40) on each side, clamped at file
  boundaries. Robust to line-number drift.
- `symbol: { path, name, occurrence? }` (or batch
  `symbols: [{ path, name, occurrence? }]`) — pull the Nth (default 1)
  top-level symbol with that name, mirroring `rewrite_symbol` occurrence
  semantics. Pair with `read_outline` to discover names.

```json
{
  "windows": [{ "path": "path/to/large-file.ts", "window": 2 }],
  "around": [
    { "path": "path/to/large-file.ts", "match": "export function loadConfig(" }
  ],
  "symbols": [{ "path": "path/to/large-file.ts", "name": "loadConfig" }]
}
```

### `read_subtree`

`read_subtree` uses the runtime's injected filesystem view for live discovery;
it never falls back to the host process filesystem. When no live view is
available, cached tree entries are returned with `provenance: "cached"` and
`stale: true`, while cache misses return a typed `unsupported` error. Live
walks reserve their 5,000-node budget (`LIVE_SUBTREE_MAX_NODES`) before scheduling work, traverse sorted
entries deterministically, stop admitting work at the limit, and report typed
per-path I/O/cancellation errors plus an aggregate `partial` status.

### `read_outline`

`read_outline` returns a structural AST-like outline of imports, exports, classes, methods, and function signatures in a source file. It allows understanding the composition of large files without loading their entire implementations, saving significant token counts and processing time.

Example:

```json
{
  "path": "sdk/src/provider-config.ts"
}
```

### `edit_transaction` and compatibility edit handlers

Shipped root, editor, test-writer, and doc-writer agents receive
`edit_transaction` as their single model-visible project mutation tool. Its
discriminated edit variants cover targeted `str_replace`, `replace_range`,
`rewrite_symbol`, unified `patch`, structured imports/insertion,
create/delete/move, and whole-file `write_file` operations. The corresponding
standalone handlers remain registered for persisted/external compatibility, but
their overlapping schemas are not added to those agents' provider prompts.
Under strict-mode edit flows all variants participate in staged
read-before-edit enforcement:

- Every edit requires an explicit `type` discriminator. Valid values are
  `str_replace`, `replace_range`, `structured`, `create`, `delete`, `move`,
  `rewrite_symbol`, `patch`, and `write_file`. The runtime infers `type` only
  when the payload shape is unambiguous (for example, `replacements` implies
  `str_replace`), but an ambiguous `{ path, content }` edit is rejected with a
  `No matching discriminator` error because it could be either `create` or
  `write_file`. Set `type` explicitly to avoid this.
- A recent complete whole-file `read_files.paths` call authorizes subsequent
  exact-match edits to that path and returns an authenticated opaque `cap.v3`
  `readCapability` bound to the project, normalized path, and current run.
  Truncated reads expose no
  capability. Range and symbol reads remain scoped and require their
  `readCapability` on the follow-up edit.
- `basedOnRead` prefers a `cap.v3` token copied from a fresh `read_files`
  range header. The runtime verifies its authentication, project/path/run
  binding, bounds, and current content hash. Legacy `cap.v2` tokens and
  explicit `{ startLine, endLine, hash }` objects remain freshness anchors for
  compatible non-strict flows, but cannot authorize an otherwise unread path.
- Model-facing `replace_range` transaction edits use
  `{ readCapability, newContent }`, add both `startLine` and `endLine` to
  target a contained sub-range, or pass `occurrence: { match, occurrence? }`
  to target the Nth literal match inside the capability-authorized range.
  `occurrence` is mutually exclusive with `startLine`/`endLine`. The
  authenticated cap.v3 token remains the
  sole freshness authority; legacy `expectedHash` tuples are rejected.
- A successful edit keeps path-level authorization during the editing flow,
  while exact-match follow-up edits chain from the latest prepared content.
  For large or ambiguous follow-up edits, carry the echoed post-edit
  `basedOnRead` forward or re-read the target range.
- Stale or failed edits should be recovered by re-reading the exact
  target range named in the diagnostic and retrying with the new
  `basedOnRead`, not by guessing from memory. A stale failure deliberately
  emits no ready-to-use capability.
- Recovery reads tolerate the common one-file shorthand
  `{ paths: ["file"], ranges: [{ startLine, endLine }] }`: when there is
  exactly one unambiguous path, the harness assigns it to the range and treats
  the request as range-only. Missing paths remain invalid for multi-file
  requests.
- Cross-turn authorization is persisted only after all in-flight read/edit
  tools settle, so the next model step receives the post-tool content hash.
- Preflight/input failures do not consume a valid whole-file read when no
  client mutation was attempted. Rejected, thrown, stale, or unconfirmed
  applications persist a typed reread reason across turns so follow-up errors
  explain why the authorization was revoked instead of reporting only a
  generic missing-read message.

The runtime-compatible standalone `str_replace` input and the transaction's
`str_replace` edit variant share these fields:

- `path` (string, required) — target file path.
- `replacements` (array, required) — each entry includes `oldString`,
  `newString`, and `allowMultiple`; optional fields are `occurrenceIndex`,
  `basedOnRead`, and `skipIfMissing`.
- `atomic` (boolean, default `false`) — when `true`, any failed
  replacement aborts the whole batch. Large files are always atomic.

On success, `str_replace` returns the updated `content`, a unified-diff
`patch`, and informational `messages`. On failure it returns an `error`
with recovery guidance and does not apply an atomic batch.

Matching behavior:

- `oldString` must be non-empty and is matched exactly after line-ending
  normalization; the result preserves the file's original line endings.
- `allowMultiple: true` replaces every exact occurrence. Without it,
  multiple matches fail with occurrence-range diagnostics.
- `occurrenceIndex` is 1-indexed and targets exactly one repeated exact
  match; when combined with a fresh `basedOnRead`, the index is counted
  within that anchored range.
- `skipIfMissing: true` is only an idempotency helper for deletions
  (`newString: ""`): if the old text is already absent, the replacement is
  reported as a successful no-op instead of a failure.
- Tiny repeated anchors are refused: an `oldString` shorter than 10
  trimmed characters that matches more than once fails even when
  `allowMultiple: true`. Use a longer `oldString` or `occurrenceIndex`.
- If exact matching fails, `oldString` may use `...` as an explicit
  line-level elision marker only when the marker is on a line by itself
  between exact literal anchor segments. Each literal segment must contain
  at least 10 non-whitespace characters, and the elided range must resolve
  to exactly one match. Ambiguous elision fails with recovery guidance;
  `allowMultiple` does not apply to elision matching.
- If exact and elision matching fail, the runtime may match
  indentation-adjusted content or a conservative near-match. Near-match
  success includes a warning and should be verified by re-reading the
  edited range.

Large-file and anchor behavior:

- Files over 1,000 lines or 100,000 characters are treated as large.
- Large-file edits use `basedOnRead` range hashes when supplied, and fall
  back only when `oldString` is deterministic: unique for single-target
  edits, or present with `allowMultiple: true` for replace-all edits.
- Supplied `basedOnRead` anchors are always scope-checked and constrain
  matching even on small files; omit the anchor when an unscoped unique
  literal edit is intended.
- Placeholder or malformed string anchors such as `"dummy"` or invalid
  `cap.*` tokens are rejected on all files unless `oldString` uniquely
  matches the current file, in which case the bogus anchor is stripped and
  the edit proceeds as an unanchored replacement.
- Successful large-file edits return fresh read capability tokens for the
  edited hunk or region. Reuse those tokens for immediate follow-up edits;
  older tokens for the same file are stale.

Example:

```json
{
  "path": "src/example.ts",
  "atomic": true,
  "replacements": [
    {
      "oldString": "const value = 1",
      "newString": "const value = 2",
      "allowMultiple": false
    },
    {
      "oldString": "debugLog()",
      "newString": "",
      "allowMultiple": true,
      "skipIfMissing": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`edit_transaction` preflights every replacement against the same
in-memory snapshot, so a preflight failure changes no files. Commit is a
coordinated sequence with verified receipts and conditional, conflict-safe
rollback where the filesystem adapter supports the required primitives.
Callers must inspect `rolled_back` and `rollback_incomplete` outcomes rather
than assuming external filesystem atomicity. Guarded updates, deletes, and
moves fail closed when an adapter cannot provide the required conditional
operation. The default SDK Node path supplies these primitives through a
worktree-scoped cooperative mutation broker with exact-byte hashes, durable
receipts, crash recovery, and no-clobber hard-link moves. It serializes
participating Openbuff processes but does not exclude arbitrary external
editors; watcher and workspace-revision invalidation remain required.
Transactions are bounded by edit, path, file-byte, prepared-state,
and rollback-state limits; split larger work into related groups. See
[Deterministic Edit System](./deterministic-edit-system.md) for the full
policy and gate semantics.

### `write_audit_findings`

`write_audit_findings` is a dedicated artifact sink for broad-audit shards.
It accepts validated `sessionSlug`, `shardId`, structured findings, and a
coverage receipt. The caller cannot provide a filesystem path: the runtime and
SDK independently derive
`.agents/sessions/<sessionSlug>/findings/<shardId>.md`. General-agent write
scope is limited to that pattern, and the SDK uses exclusive creation so two
shards cannot silently overwrite one artifact. The result contains only the
artifact path, finding/severity/coverage counts, and content hash; the
synthesizer reads the Markdown artifacts directly.

### `record_decision`

`record_decision` is the first-class explicit decision save. It appends one decision, fact, or constraint to task memory with required evidence.

Bounds: `text` 1..1024 characters (trimmed, non-empty); `kind` `decision`|`fact`|`constraint` (default `decision`); `evidenceSelectors` 1..32 project-relative paths (each 1..1024 chars, no traversal, no glob syntax); optional `excerpt` at most 1024 characters. Private, generated, dependency, and sensitive paths are rejected via the shared memory-artifact policy. Persisted text is untrusted evidence, never an instruction. The contract is additive only: it appends to `taskMemory.decisions` plus one `decision` evidence entry (both bounded) and never rewrites history. Runtime-only: no SDK dispatch and no client wire change — the SDK-dispatch registration check is expected to fail by design.

```json
{
  "text": "Use Postgres for session storage",
  "kind": "decision",
  "evidenceSelectors": ["docs/architecture.md"]
}
```

### `create_plan` and `update_plan_status`

`update_plan_status` is the right tool for incremental status or lesson
updates.

These tools back the PlanLink slash commands (`/resume-plan`,
`/update-plan`, `/plan-status`, `/lessons`); `/plans` and `/plan-use`
select and inspect which session those tools operate on, with
`/plan-use` writing the `.agents/ACTIVE_SESSION` pointer. See
[Local Mode](./local-mode.md) for the user-facing command list.

### `git_branch`

`git_branch` creates a new git branch in the current project, optionally switching to it. It is the first-class agent-side branch-creation tool (no `run_terminal_command` needed). Branch creation is a first-class agent operation that does NOT require `run_terminal_command`.

By default the tool refuses to branch when the working tree is dirty (uncommitted changes) — pass `allow_dirty: true` to override (useful when intentionally moving uncommitted work to a new branch). Branch names must start with an alphanumeric character and contain only `[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]` (intentionally stricter than git's own rules, to keep names predictable and shell-safe).

Input fields:

- `branch_name` (string, required) — name of the branch to create.
- `switch` (boolean, default `true`) — when `true`, create AND switch to the branch (`git checkout -b`); when `false`, only create the branch (`git branch`), leaving the current branch checked out.
- `allow_dirty` (boolean, default `false`) — when `true`, skip the dirty-tree refusal check.

Example:

```json
{
  "branch_name": "feat/my-feature",
  "switch": true
}
```

On success the result carries `branch`, `created: true`, `switched`, and (when switching) `previousBranch`. On failure it carries an `errorMessage` (invalid name, dirty tree, or non-zero git exit). `git_branch` is registered as an orchestrator tool and is available to `git-committer` (which yields a `git_branch` step before its `git status --short` step when `branch_name` is supplied via its input schema).

### Direct subagent tool calls

Spawnable agents are also exposed to the model as direct tool aliases. The
runtime derives each alias from the agent id's short name by replacing
hyphens with underscores; for example, `openbuff/file-picker@1.0.0`
becomes the `file_picker` tool. The direct call is transformed into a
single-entry `spawn_agents` call before execution, so normal spawn
permissions and agent-template validation still apply.

Input fields:

- `prompt` (string, optional) — the prompt forwarded to the child agent.
- `params` (object, optional) — parameters object for the child agent.
  Direct agent schemas also accept a stringified JSON object for `params`
  and parse it before validation; malformed JSON, arrays, and objects that
  `spawn_agents.agents` also performs bounded repair for one- or
  double-stringified arrays and stringified object entries. Malformed or
  truncated JSON remains rejected; the runtime never fabricates an empty agent
  entry or silently drops required parameters. Stringified `params` and
  `handoff` objects are decoded at their envelope boundary only; legitimate
  nested string values such as shell commands remain strings. Basher requires
  `params.command`. Reviewer-family specialists accept `params.snapshot_id` only
  on runtime-owned programmatic spawns, where the parent gate mints the exact
  current opaque `v3:…` token (never bare `get_change_review_bundle.snapshotId`
  hex, which is evidence-only); manual/advisory prompt-authored spawns must omit
  `params.snapshot_id` entirely — put the scoped file list in `params.files` and
  the review question in the prompt. Only `security-reviewer` accepts
  `params.snapshot_fingerprint` (with `params.changed_files`), and manual spawns
  omit that key too.

string:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Run pwd",
  "params": "{\"command\":\"pwd\"}"
}
```

Gotchas: the alias name is only for the provider-facing tool call; the
spawn entry keeps the original agent id. Explicit `params` values are
preserved and validated downstream, including invalid primitive values,
so this compatibility layer does not weaken required agent parameters.

### `spawn_agent_inline`

`spawn_agent_inline` is an orchestrator-internal tool that spawns a single
child agent with a **snapshot of the parent's message history**. Its schema
lives in `common/src/tools/params/tool/spawn-agent-inline.ts` and its
handler in
`packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/tool/spawn-agent-inline.ts`.
It is distinct from `spawn_agents` (the visible multi-agent spawn tool):
`spawn_agent_inline` is hidden from the TUI tool palette and is used by
the automated phase-gates and the `context-pruner` flow, where the child
must share the parent's conversation context.

Input fields:

- `agent_type` (string, required) — the child agent id to spawn.
- `prompt` (string, optional) — the prompt forwarded to the child.
- `params` (object, optional) — parameters object for the child agent.
- `handoff` (object, optional) — structured handoff payload, merged into
  the child's `spawnParams` (purely additive; children that do not
  consume `handoff` still receive `prompt` and `params`).

Example:

```json
{
  "agent_type": "file-picker",
  "prompt": "Find files related to authentication",
  "params": { "paths": ["src/auth.ts", "src/user.ts"] }
}
```

The child's template overrides are forced by the inline handler:
`includeMessageHistory: true` and `inheritParentSystemPrompt: true`,
regardless of what the agent template declares. The child sees the parent's
`systemPrompt` and a filtered copy of its `messageHistory`, but ordinary inline
agents do not write their private reads, tool results, or intermediate prose
back into the orchestrator history. Their final output is returned as the
`spawn_agent_inline` tool result. If a programmatic inline child deliberately
deletes, reorders, or rewrites inherited messages with `set_messages`, that
control-plane mutation is propagated; append-only private child activity is
not. `context-pruner` is always propagated because its compacted history must
replace the parent history.

Structured reviewer outputs are bounded before entering the parent history:
all findings, corrections, dimensions, file lists, and snapshot receipts are
retained, while repetitive evidence lists are capped and long evidence strings
preserve bounded beginnings and endings. Full child activity still streams to
the TUI under the child block; it is simply not replayed into later model
requests. The child runs until it calls `end_turn`, then control returns to the
parent. Because the spawn ends the current agent step (`endsAgentStep: true`),
the parent emits a new step after the child returns.

#### Event nesting (`parentAgentId`)

The handler's `onResponseChunk` callback tags each forwarded
`PrintModeEvent` with a `parentAgentId` so the CLI can nest the child's
output under the correct agent block:

| Event type                                           | injected field                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `subagent_start` / `subagent_finish`                 | `parentAgentId` set to the **parent orchestrator's** `agentId` (or the event's existing `parentAgentId` if already set), so the child block nests under the orchestrator |
| `tool_call` / `tool_result`                          | `parentAgentId` set to the **child's** `agentId`, so the child's tool calls render inside the child's own agent block, not the orchestrator's                            |
| `text`                                               | `agentId` set to the **child's** `agentId` (empty `text` is dropped), so child prose attributes to the child block                                                       |
| other events (e.g. `reasoning_delta`, plain strings) | forwarded verbatim, no field injected                                                                                                                                    |

This mirrors the `ensureParentAgentId` logic the `spawn_agents` handler
applies, and is what makes an aux-gate `test-writer` / `doc-writer` /
`security-reviewer` spawn render inside its own labeled box in the TUI
rather than blending into the orchestrator's turn.

#### `context-pruner` silencing

When the resolved `agent_type` is the context-pruner, the handler suppresses
**all** forwarded chunks (including the child's `subagent_start` /
`subagent_finish` emitted by `executeSubagent`), so the pruner runs silently and
produces no TUI output. Identity here is matched by **bare agent id** through
`isContextPrunerAgentId`, not by exact string equality: `context-pruner`,
`acme/context-pruner`, `acme/context-pruner@1.2.3`, and underscore aliases such
as `context_pruner` all qualify and are silenced identically. That is a
widening of the previous exact `agent_type === 'context-pruner'` rule — see
"Spawned agents have three parent-history transfer modes" below for the rest of
the contract the same match governs (full parent transcript, forced
`inheritParentSystemPrompt`, transcript write-back, and the anti-thrash skip),
and `sdk/CHANGELOG.md` for the consumer migration note. The `TODO` in source
notes a future option may make the silencing configurable.

#### Context-window-aware compaction budgets

The parent agent state carries the provider/model's resolved
`contextWindowTokens` before the first programmatic step. Semantic compaction
uses that value instead of treating every model as 200k-class:

| Resolved window | Semantic trigger | History target | Provider-safe request limit |
| --------------: | ---------------: | -------------: | --------------------------: |
|              8k |               2k |          1,400 |                          4k |
|             16k |            5,600 |          2,800 |                          8k |
|             32k |           16,800 |          8,400 |                         24k |
|             64k |           39,200 |         19,600 |                         56k |
|            128k |           89,600 |            72k |                     112.64k |
|            200k |             140k |            72k |                        176k |
|         262,144 |          183,500 |         91,750 |                     230,687 |
|            500k |             350k |           175k |                        440k |
|              1m |             700k |           350k |                        880k |

For 128k-and-larger windows, the trigger is bounded by both a 70% ratio and
explicit 32k–160k semantic headroom. The target is 35% of the resolved window,
bounded to 72k–420k, and
is split across assistant/tool-call summaries, user text, and tool-result
facts. Unknown or invalid provider windows conservatively fall back to a 140k
trigger and 100k target. Explicit test/debug `maxContextLength` overrides also
cap the target so compaction cannot produce a summary larger than the custom
trigger. Within each category, the pruner prefers recent entries but skips an
oversized entry and continues scanning for older compact evidence instead of
discarding the remainder of that category.

For windows below 128k, fixed 32k/72k minima would consume the whole model
budget. Those models instead scale both semantic headroom and target from the
provider-safe message limit, retaining a meaningful working set for 8k–64k
BYOK models. The pre-request budget uses the smallest declared window across
each agent's independently routed primary model and configured failovers. This
keeps a large primary safe when it fails over to a smaller model instead of
expanding the history after a successful primary request. The SDK still
enforces the actual attempt's provider-safe limit at dispatch time. Explicit
`maxContextLength` overrides are clamped and cannot widen the active model.

The pinned task contract retains a bounded beginning-and-end view of the latest
live user request plus a bounded next action. Both limits are _baseline_ caps at
the legacy 100k target (2,400 characters for the goal, 1,400 for the next
action) and are scaled by the same `clamp(targetTokens / 100_000, 0.5, 3.0)`
factor as the rest of the pinned block, so they are not fixed absolutes: the
default 200k-class window resolves a 72k semantic target (scale `0.72`) and
therefore caps the goal at ~1,728 and the next action at ~1,008 characters,
while a ~1m-token window resolves ~350k and reaches the 3x clamp (7,200 /
4,200). Size prompts against the scaled value for the active window, not against
the 100k baseline. This preserves both initial requirements and trailing
instructions when a user pastes a long failure transcript. Reviewer blockers use
larger bounded entries, while inline reviewer internals are isolated before
compaction so they do not consume the orchestrator's history budget in the first
place.

Mechanical trimming remains a later emergency brake. Its provider-safe limit
reserves 12% of the declared window, bounded to 8k–128k, for system prompts,
tool schemas, output, and provider accounting. Compaction events report the
resolved window, trigger budget, target budget, and reason, along with category
telemetry and whether `<knowledge_memory>` survived. The existing pinned
control-plane, blocker, validation, review-receipt, and high-value finding
extraction remains authoritative across repeated compaction.

The SDK's request-time brake (`getMessagesForModelContext`) subtracts this
request's counted system-prompt and tool-schema tokens from the resolved message
limit. Tool names, descriptions, and plain JSON Schemas are counted exactly,
while an opaque Zod/Standard Schema `inputSchema` is converted to a real JSON
Schema and counted from that projection, clamped between a per-tool floor and a
per-tool ceiling and falling back to the floor when the conversion is not
possible. Its `cache_emergency_trim` log and analytics payload separate the two
budgets explicitly: `maxTotalTokens` is the resolved _request_ budget,
`systemTokens` is the counted overhead, and `effectiveMessageBudgetTokens` is
the message-only budget actually applied. `triggerBudgetTokens` and
`targetBudgetTokens` — the pair consumers compare against message token counts,
including the `trigger=`/`target=` numbers in the log line — report that same
message-only budget, so no emitted field is ambiguous about which threshold
fired. With no counted overhead the message-only budget equals
`maxTotalTokens`, so those values are unchanged.

`context_compaction` telemetry is additive on the public `handleEvent` surface.
`resolvedContextWindowTokens`, `triggerBudgetTokens`, `targetBudgetTokens`,
`compactionCount`, `consecutiveNoProgressCompactions`, `shortfallTokens`,
`fitsBudget`, and `escalated` are all optional in
`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`, so persisted or replayed events emitted before
this telemetry existed still validate and no consumer migration is required.
Consumers that ignore the new fields keep their previous behavior; the CLI
treats `fitsBudget: false` or two-or-more consecutive low-yield passes as a
degraded compaction.

The CLI records each compaction pass as a typed `compaction` content block
(`CompactionContentBlock` in `cli/src/types/chat.ts`, rendered by
`CompactionBox`) instead of appending the previous concatenated `text` block.
Blocks are persisted to `chat-messages.json` and replayed on reload, so the
renderer sanitizes missing, non-finite, negative, or unknown-category values
coming back from an older session, and a replayed session that still holds the
old free-text notice keeps rendering as plain text.

The persisted block's `status` field enumerates four values:

- absent or `'complete'` — a finished pass. Absent is what every block written
  before the field existed holds, so an older replayed session still renders as
  a completed pass.
- `'pending'` — live in the producing process only, identified by the
  `liveSessionId` stamp described below.
- `'interrupted'` — terminal: the run ended (abort or turn teardown) before the
  pass reported anything, so that path rewrites `'pending'` to it and a block
  that reaches persistence never claims to still be running.
- `'declined'` — terminal: the pass RAN and reclaimed nothing, because the
  runtime settled it without ever reporting a result. Distinct from
  `'interrupted'` (the pass completed); the card reads "Compaction pass —
  nothing reclaimed" and its result lines stay suppressed.

Two optional fields are persisted alongside it. `subagent: true` marks a pass
performed by a foreground subagent or inline agent run (non-empty
`ancestorRunIds`) so the card is labelled as a nested pass; it is absent on root
passes and on blocks written by an older CLI, which are therefore read as root
passes. `trimSource: 'request'` marks the SDK's request-time emergency trim
(`context_request_trim`), a strictly later and more severe brake than the
runtime-owned passes; it is absent for the runtime passes and for every block
written by an older CLI.

The format stays additive, but forward replay is not symmetric with backward
replay, so both directions are stated explicitly:

- Forward (older block, current CLI): every added field is optional and its
  absent value is exactly the previous behavior, so prior sessions round-trip
  unchanged.
- Backward (block written by this version, replayed by an older CLI): the older
  renderer knows only `pending`/`complete`/`interrupted`, so it falls through to
  its completed-pass branch for an unknown `status`. A `'declined'` block —
  whose result fields are the zeroed placeholders of a pass that never reported
  one — therefore renders there as a completed pass claiming `→ 0 tokens
(−0%)`, and `subagent`/`trimSource` are dropped, so a nested or request-time
  trim is presented as a root-level runtime pass. That mis-rendering is
  cosmetic and confined to the transcript card: no persisted field is
  reinterpreted, nothing fails to parse, and the session still loads. Consumers
  that must stay readable by an older CLI should treat an unknown `status` as
  non-terminal-unknown rather than as `complete`.

The pinned `<knowledge_memory>` block's per-field caps scale with the resolved
semantic target budget instead of being fixed. The scale factor is
`targetTokens / 100_000`, clamped to `[0.5, 3.0]`, so the legacy 100k target is
the scale-factor-`1.0` baseline: 12 decisions, 25 files inspected, 25 edits, 12
validation results, 12 review receipts, 16 post-edit anchors, 12 blockers, a
2,400-character goal, a 1,400-character next action, and 480-character entries.
That baseline is not a byte-identical replay of the previous fixed caps: this
change also raised three of them — decisions 8 -> 12, blockers 8 -> 12, and the
next action 1,000 -> 1,400 characters. Every other baseline cap is unchanged
from before: the 2,400-character goal, 25 files inspected, 25 edits, 12
validation results, 12 review receipts, 16 post-edit anchors, and 480-character
entries. A ~1m-token window resolves to a ~350k target and
therefore retains 3x those counts, while a small BYOK window scales down to
0.5x. Per-entry character caps — including the goal and next-action caps above —
scale by the same factor, so the baseline numbers above hold only at the legacy
100k target. The default 200k-class window resolves a 72k target (scale `0.72`)
and yields 9 decisions, 18 files inspected, 18 edits, 9 validation results, 9
review receipts, 12 post-edit anchors, 9 blockers, a ~1,728-character goal, a
~1,008-character next action, and ~346-character entries.

Because that block is pinned verbatim and exempt from the normal budget cutoff,
deeper retention is bounded by a hard ceiling of
`max(1_500, floor(targetTokens * 0.25))` estimated tokens. When the block
exceeds it, entries are evicted oldest-first in a fixed priority order:
`postEditAnchors` -> `filesInspected` -> `decisions` -> `validationResults` ->
`reviewReceipts` -> `editsMade` -> `blockers`. `Goal:` and `Next Action:` are
never dropped; under extreme pressure they are truncated (beginning-and-end
preserving) toward floors of 480 and 240 characters respectively. These caps
live in the serialized `handleSteps` of `agents/context-pruner.ts`, outside the
machine-generated `<pruner-budgets-generated>` region that stays owned by
`scripts/generate-pruner-budgets.ts`.

Live compaction state is reported by a separate additive
`context_compaction_status` event on the public `handleEvent` surface
(`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`), not by the `context_compaction` result. It
carries `state: 'started' | 'settled'`, the required agent/run correlation
`runId` and `ancestorRunIds` (plus an optional `agentId`), and optional
`contextTokens`, `resolvedContextWindowTokens`, `triggerBudgetTokens`, and
`targetBudgetTokens`, and `evictedTokens`. `packages/agent-runtime/src/run-agent-step.ts` emits
`started` immediately before the programmatic step whenever the window-derived
semantic trigger is exceeded AND the run's loop-local token-state compaction
governor allows the pass — a pacing state machine (armed → cooldown →
rearm-pending, with a per-turn pass cap and an emergency override at the
provider-safe limit) that bounds how often the expensive full-transcript pruner
pass may run per turn — whether or not the agent has a `handleSteps`
generator: an orchestrator's generator spawns the pruner itself, while a
prompt-only template gets a runtime-driven pass
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/runtime-semantic-compaction.ts`). Two
additional gates apply, and both suppress the announcement as well as the pass:
a governor-denied iteration, and the transient loop-owned anti-thrash advisory
(`suppressSemanticCompaction`, set after consecutive passes reclaim no space
and reset at loop entry). For
the runtime-driven pass the ordinary spawn-permission contract also applies, so a
prompt-only template that does not declare `context-pruner` in its
`spawnableAgents` announces a pass that then declines to spawn. Emission is
deliberately not gated on an explicit `maxContextLength` override. Before the
governor is even consulted, a deterministic zero-cost tool-result evictor
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/tool-result-eviction.ts`) replaces stale
tool-result bodies with tombstones whenever context exceeds the eviction floor
(55% of the window) — and it is importance-aware: paths recorded in task
memory (evidence, inspected files, edits) mark tool results that cite them as
protected, so the evictor cannot strip the context behind a recorded decision.
The tokens it frees are reported as `evictedTokens` and frequently pull
context below the semantic trigger so no LLM pass is needed.
`settled` is emitted after both compaction branches whenever a `started` was
emitted, and again on the run's exit path when a step throws or is cancelled
before reaching them, so a pass that decides not to compact cannot leave a
pending state on screen. As with `job_update`, consumers should treat unknown
event variants as no-ops; no consumer migration is required.

Compaction also carries a recall leg so its information loss stays
recoverable. Before a semantic pass or mechanical trim rewrites history, the
runtime archives the pre-compaction transcript onto the new optional
`AgentState.compactionArchive`
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/context-archive.ts`, capped at 8 snapshots
of 200 messages with 4k-char per-message truncation; plain JSON, so sessions
persisted before the field existed parse without it). The registered
`recall_context` tool (granted to base2 CORE) searches those archived tool
bodies with bounded case-insensitive AND-match snippets and returns
provenance, so pre-compaction content is always marked stale-until-verified;
the archive itself never enters the model context. Eviction is deliberately
NOT archived: tombstones already instruct a re-run, and a fresh read of live
files is more faithful than a stale body. After a semantic pass, the runtime
verifies the extraction
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/compaction-verification.ts`): expected facts
(paths read or written, truncated commands) are derived from the
PRE-compaction transcript and checked against the post-compaction history and
task memory, and gaps are named in the `context_compaction` event's
`recovery` guidance so the user sees what was lost and how to recover it
(`recall_context` or a re-read). Deterministic fidelity scoring lives in
`evals/compaction-fidelity/scenario.test.ts` (F1–F4, no LLM calls).

An OPTIONAL background consolidation leg (canary-gated OFF by default) adds
bounded SUMMARIES on top of the verbatim archive: when a template sets
`programmaticConfig.backgroundSnapshotConsolidation === true`, the runtime
fires a fire-and-forget prompt-only LLM child
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/context-consolidation-runner.ts`) after each
compaction settle that summarizes up to 3 not-yet-consolidated archive
snapshots (oldest first, char-budgeted newest-first prompt; identifiers,
paths, commands, and numbers preserved verbatim by instruction). The summary
is stored capped (8 × 6k chars) on the new optional
`AgentState.contextConsolidations` (`common/src/types/context-consolidation.ts`)
and is surfaced by `recall_context` as an additive `consolidations` section
(OR-ranked, max 3 hits, with `sourceArchivedAts` staleness provenance) —
omitted entirely when no consolidations exist, so the tool's output contract
is unchanged for sessions that never enable the canary. The child has NO
tools and NO transcript write-back: its only product is the summary string,
it never delays the agent step (the trigger call is synchronous and cheap;
the LLM run continues in the background), and its failure is logged and
dropped — the verbatim archive remains the source of truth. Because the
background child costs one small LLM call per consolidation run, the canary
is OFF by default and a template must opt in explicitly; summaries are
agent-stale-by-construction (they describe PRE-compaction content) and cite
their snapshot provenance for exactly that reason.

Because every `loopAgentSteps` invocation emits these events — the root turn,
foreground subagents, and inline agents alike — the protocol is scoped by run
for both producers and consumers. Each emission carries the emitting run's own
`runId` and `ancestorRunIds`, `ancestorRunIds` is empty **only** for the root
run (the same convention as `reasoning_delta`), and a run has at most one
unsettled `started` at a time. Consumers must therefore pair `started` with the
`settled` of the **same** `runId`, so concurrent or nested loops cannot
cross-settle each other, and a consumer that renders live compaction state as
root-level UI must ignore events with a non-empty `ancestorRunIds` instead of
showing a subagent's compaction as a root-level card. The sibling
`compactionCount` on the `context_compaction` result is scoped the same way: it
counts the emitting run's own passes, not a per-turn total across nested runs,
so only the root run's count may be adopted as the turn total. The result event
carries the same three correlation fields, but optionally, so persisted or
replayed events emitted before they existed still validate and stay
root-attributed.

Only `runId` and `ancestorRunIds` are authoritative on the delivered payload;
the optional `agentId` is not. The `spawn_agents` forwarding path in
`packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/tool/spawn-agents.ts` rewrites
`agentId` to the direct child's agent id on every forwarded event that is not
`text`, `tool_call`/`tool_result`, or `subagent_start`/`subagent_finish` — which
includes both compaction events — while spreading the rest of the payload
unchanged. A depth-1 child's events therefore still carry the emitter's own
agent id, but for a run nested two or more levels deep the delivered `agentId`
names the nearest forwarding child rather than the emitting agent. `runId` and
`ancestorRunIds` survive every hop, so consumers must key per-agent compaction
state off `runId`, use `ancestorRunIds` for lineage, and treat `agentId` as a
best-effort display hint.

In the CLI, a root-run `started` appends a pending `compaction` block stamped
with that `runId` (`CompactionContentBlock.runId`) that the terminal
`context_compaction` result of the same run replaces in place (a second result
in the same iteration appends instead), a root-run `settled` rewrites only that
run's still-pending block to the terminal `status: 'declined'` card — the pass
ran and reclaimed nothing, so the transcript keeps an honest trace of it instead
of the card being deleted, and consecutive declined cards of the same run
collapse into one — and `handleFinish` clears any stray pending block,
including uncorrelated ones replayed from an older session, at the turn
boundary.

A subagent's status event never adds, settles, or declines a root-level card,
but it is not ignored for root-level state: its `runId` is recorded in the
notice's `pendingRunIds` set, and the `pending` flag behind the root-level
status chip is derived from that set. The chip therefore reports a live pass
while any run — root or nested — has an unsettled `started`, and only that run's
own `settled` removes its entry. A subagent result likewise contributes one
completed pass to the status-bar count without overwriting the root turn's total
or clearing its live chip.

The request-time brake reports itself through its own additive
`context_request_trim` event on the public `handleEvent` surface
(`common/src/types/print-mode.ts`). It fires only when the dispatch-time trim
actually dropped messages, and it is a DIFFERENT event from
`context_compaction`: reaching it means every runtime brake above it was already
exceeded, so the two must never be merged or counted as one pass. Its required
fields are `messageBudgetTokens` (the message-only budget actually applied, i.e.
the resolved request budget minus the counted system + tool surface),
`beforeTokens`/`afterTokens`, and `beforeMessages`/`afterMessages`; `runId`,
`ancestorRunIds`, `agentId`, `resolvedContextWindowTokens`, and `model` are
optional, with the same correlation semantics (and the same `agentId` caveat) as
the status event above. The CLI renders it as a `compaction` block marked
`trimSource: 'request'` with its own "Context trimmed at request time" title: it
never consumes an announced pending card, because it settles no announced pass,
and it always degrades the turn's compaction chip. Consumers that only care
about runtime-owned compaction can ignore the variant entirely.

Two more additive surfaces accompany it. The `context_window` event gained
optional `compactionTriggerTokens` and `compactionTargetTokens`, which report
the runtime's model-aware semantic-compaction budget for the ACTIVE model
(exactly what `getSemanticCompactionBudget` returns for the resolved window), so
a UI can show where compaction will fire instead of surprising the user with it;
both are optional, so replayed events emitted before they existed still validate
and a consumer that ignores them renders exactly as before. On the SDK side, the
published `promptAiSdk`, `promptAiSdkStream`, and `promptAiSdkStructured`
signatures gained an optional `onRequestContextTrimmed` callback and its
`RequestContextTrimInfo` payload type (`common/src/types/contracts/llm.ts`,
implemented in `sdk/src/impl/llm.ts`). It is purely observational: it can never
affect the trim result, a throwing consumer is caught and logged rather than
aborting dispatch, and existing callers that omit it are unaffected. All three
additions are additive and require no consumer migration.

One cleanup path stays unreachable by construction: a user-initiated abort makes
the SDK drop every post-abort event, so neither `settled` nor `handleFinish`
can run, and the turn's blocks are persisted to `chat-messages.json` afterwards.
A pending block is therefore stamped with `liveSessionId`
(`CLI_LIVE_SESSION_ID` in `cli/src/types/chat.ts`, an opaque per-process id) and
is only rendered as live while that stamp matches the current process.
A replayed pending block — an absent stamp from an older CLI, or a foreign one
from the aborted session — renders as "Compaction interrupted" with its result
lines still suppressed, never as a permanent "Compacting context…" card. The
status-bar chip applies the same rule live: `pending` is only honored while the
run is active, so an aborted turn falls back to the settled `⇲ compacted ×N`
form and drops the chip entirely when no pass ever completed. The field is
optional and additive, so persisted blocks from before it round-trip unchanged.

Operational memory is also stored as versioned typed task memory with a
revision CAS and checksum. Requirements, decisions, blockers, files, edits,
validation, review receipts, workspace revision, and next actions survive
transcript replacement independently of prose summaries. Every provider request
gets a role- and model-bounded compiled view; stale read/edit/validation/review
evidence from an older workspace revision is excluded. Critical recall fields
are budgeted before lower-priority evidence and the compiler always emits valid
structured JSON, including for small models.

Spawned agents have three parent-history transfer modes: `none`, `pinned`, and
`full`. Ordinary specialists default to no inherited history; ordinary inline
specialists default to the bounded `pinned` mode, which transfers only the
newest `<pinned_active_work_state>` and `<knowledge_memory>` blocks. The
context-pruner remains the explicit `full`-history exception because editing
the parent transcript is its job, and `spawn_agent_inline` matches that
exception by bare agent id rather than by exact string equality:
`isContextPrunerAgentId` normalizes the declared `agent_type` and compares only
the bare segment, so a publisher-qualified or version-pinned declaration —
`acme/context-pruner`, `acme/context-pruner@1.2.3`, or an underscore alias — is
treated identically to the bare `context-pruner`. Every agent that matches gets
the whole pruner contract: the full parent transcript
(`messageHistoryMode: 'full'`), forced `inheritParentSystemPrompt: true`, fully
silenced child output, and write-back of the child's transcript over the
parent's `messageHistory`. The operative pruner params the runtime injects into
a serialized `handleSteps` are matched the same way (`isContextPrunerAgentId`
over the template id and the resolved `agentType` in
`packages/agent-runtime/src/run-programmatic-step.ts`): the model-aware
`semanticBudget`, the parent's `taskMemory` and `workspaceState`, and the
caller's `maxContextLength` clamped to the resolved model message limit. That
injection is what lets the pruner's transactional `set_messages` publish a
matching `expectedTaskMemoryRevision`; keying it off the bare literal instead
would leave a pinned pruner on its embedded budget arithmetic and a `-1`
revision, so `commitTaskMemory` would reject the transcript replacement for
exactly the spellings documented as equivalent. The same match also governs the transient
`suppressSemanticCompaction` anti-thrash skip, which declines a pruner spawn —
after its input is validated — for the rest of a turn whose consecutive
semantic passes reclaimed no context space. The skip also applies on an
over-trigger iteration the loop's compaction governor denies, so the
generator-driven spawn path honors the same pacing. Custom history editors must opt in
with both `messageHistoryMode: 'full'` and
`propagateMessageHistoryChanges: true`.
Ordinary inline children have independent system prompts, tools, and
`agentContext`, and their private transcripts are never copied back into the
parent. Structured handoffs and child results are bounded before entering the
receiving agent's history; large outputs degrade to a compact receipt instead
of injecting an unbounded child transcript.
Typed task memory follows the same boundary: `none` receives no parent task
memory, while `pinned`/`full` receive an isolated clone. Children never inherit
the parent's resolved context window because their configured model route is
resolved independently.

Automatic semantic or mechanical compaction forces a main-agent checkpoint
before the next provider request. Manual `/compact` uses the same
`<conversation_summary>/<historical_memory>` envelope and preserves the newest
authoritative pinned blocks rather than the first block found in history.
`set_messages` replaces the transcript and commits the next task-memory
revision atomically, so a stale or partially completed compactor cannot erase
newer operational memory.

### Tool-result message builders

Tool handlers build structured tool results and convert the internal
`Message[]` history into the shape the AI SDK sends to providers. The
public contract lives in `common/src/util/messages.ts` and is consumed by
every tool handler in `packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/tool/`.

#### `jsonToolResult`

`jsonToolResult<T>(value: T)` returns a one-element tuple shaped as the
`json` variant of `ToolResultOutput` for a `tool`-role message's `content`
array. It is the single constructor tool handlers use to produce JSON
results (e.g. `read_files`, `read_subtree`, `spawn_agents`,
`web-search`).

```ts
import { jsonToolResult } from '@codebuff/common/src/util/messages'

// Object value — passes through unchanged.
return { output: jsonToolResult({ result: 'success', count: 3 }) }

// Primitive value — passes through unchanged.
return { output: jsonToolResult('terminal output') }
```

The value is run through `sanitizeJsonToolResultValue` before being
wrapped in the `{ type: 'json', value }` tuple. Sanitization rules
applied to every value (top-level and nested):

- `null`, `string`, `boolean`, finite `number` pass through.
- `bigint` is stringified; `function` and `symbol` are dropped from
  object properties.
- `undefined` object keys are omitted; `undefined` values in arrays or
  at the top level become `null`, matching JSON array semantics.
- Circular references become the string `"[Circular]"`.
- Values with a custom `toJSON()` are invoked and the result is
  sanitized recursively.

**Top-level arrays pass through unchanged.** The AI SDK's
`modelMessageSchema` accepts bare-array tool-result values, so
`jsonToolResult` does **not** wrap a top-level array in an envelope. A
handler that returns `jsonToolResult(reports)` where `reports` is an
array will appear to the model as the bare array. Nested arrays (arrays
that live inside an object value) are also preserved as arrays.

```ts
// Top-level array — passes through unchanged.
jsonToolResult([{ path: 'a.ts' }, { path: 'b.ts' }])
// → [{ type: 'json', value: [{ path: 'a.ts' }, { path: 'b.ts' }] }]

// Nested array inside an object — preserved as-is.
jsonToolResult({ files: ['a.ts', 'b.ts'] })
// → [{ type: 'json', value: { files: ['a.ts', 'b.ts'] } }]
```

This contract is regression-tested in
`common/src/util/__tests__/messages.test.ts` (unit tests on
`jsonToolResult` plus an integration test through
`convertCbToModelMessages`).

#### `mediaToolResult`

`mediaToolResult({ data, mediaType })` returns the `media` variant of
`ToolResultOutput`, used by tool handlers that return image or file
binary content. The `data` is a base64 string and `mediaType` is the
MIME type (e.g. `image/png`).

#### `convertCbToModelMessages`

`convertCbToModelMessages({ messages, includeCacheControl?, logger? })`
is the boundary that shapes the internal `Message[]` history into the AI
SDK's `ModelMessage[]` for a provider request. It is the sole caller of
`jsonToolResult`'s schema-validation path and is invoked by
`sdk/src/impl/llm.ts` before each model call.

Behavior:

- Converts each role: `system` flattens its text parts, `user` and
  `assistant` pass through (string assistant content is wrapped in a
  text part), and `tool` is split into `tool-result` parts (or `file`
  parts for media results). JSON `tool-result` values are sanitized at
  this conversion boundary too, so raw or persisted tool outputs that
  bypassed `jsonToolResult` cannot send `undefined`, functions, symbols,
  non-finite numbers, or circular objects into `modelMessageSchema`.
- Filters **orphan tool results** — `tool`-role messages whose
  `toolCallId` has no preceding `assistant` tool-call with the same id
  are dropped before validation, with a debug log when a `logger` is
  supplied. This prevents persisted history from carrying stale tool
  results that would fail the SDK schema.
- Aggregates consecutive same-role messages (system/user/assistant) only
  when their `timeToLive`, `providerOptions`, and `tags` are equal, so
  tag-bearing prompt boundaries are never merged together.
- When `includeCacheControl` is `true` (default), applies up to 3
  Anthropic prompt-cache breakpoints on stable prefix boundaries:
  system message, last message before the earliest live-prompt tag
  (`USER_PROMPT` / `STEP_PROMPT`), and the tail message. Set-dedup
  keeps the count within Anthropic's 4-breakpoint limit.
- Runs every aggregated message through `modelMessageSchema.safeParse`
  and throws `convertCbToModelMessages: Message at index N failed
schema validation.` on failure, with the full message, aggregated
  array, and zod error logged when a `logger` is supplied.

#### `getCacheAnchorSummary`

`getCacheAnchorSummary(messages: Message[])` is the crash-safe telemetry
egress for the cache-control strategy above. It returns the anchor
metadata (type, index, djb2 content hash, reason) that
`convertCbToModelMessages` would apply, without mutating the messages.
It is used by the cache-debug snapshots in
`packages/agent-runtime/src/util/cache-debug.ts` so developers can diff
which message indices received cache control and whether they stay
stable across requests (cache hits) or churn every turn (cache misses).
On any internal conversion error it returns `[]`, so telemetry never
breaks the request flow.

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are the TUI-level command surface (the `/<id>` entries in
the command palette). Their static registry lives in
`cli/src/data/slash-commands.ts` and is exported as one array plus two
derived helpers:

- `SLASH_COMMANDS: SlashCommand[]` — the authoritative list of every
  registered command (mode commands are generated from `AGENT_MODES`).
- `SLASHLESS_COMMAND_IDS: Set<string>` — the lowercased ids of every
  command flagged `implicitCommand: true`. These are the commands that
  can be invoked without a leading `/` when the input matches the id
  exactly with no arguments (e.g. `init` or `new`).
- `getSlashCommandsWithSkills(skills, fileTree?): SlashCommand[]` —
  returns the base `SLASH_COMMANDS` with one `skill:<name>` entry appended
  per discovered skill, plus (when `fileTree` is provided) game-dev task
  preset commands for each detected game engine. The CLI's `Chat`
  component calls this with the project file tree so engine-detected
  commands appear in the palette.

### `SlashCommand` shape

Every entry conforms to the `SlashCommand` interface:

- `id` / `label` — the command id and palette label (lowercased for
  matching).
- `description` — one-line text shown in the palette.
- `aliases` (optional) — alternate ids that resolve to the same handler.
- `implicitCommand` (optional) — when `true`, the command is also
  reachable without the `/` prefix if the input is exactly the id (no
  args). Aliases are never implicit.
- `insertText` (optional) — when set, selecting the command inserts this
  text into the input field instead of executing a handler. Used for
  agent shortcuts (e.g. `agent:general` inserts `@general-agent `).

### Registered commands

The static command set (current as of the source file) is grouped by
purpose:

| Group              | Commands                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diagnostics / info | `info` (`status`), `help` (`h`, `?`, implicit), `setup`, `models`, `provider`                       |
| Project scaffold   | `init` (implicit)                                                                                   |
| Provider account   | `connect` (`chatgpt`, `connect:chatgpt`) — only present when `CHATGPT_OAUTH_ENABLED` is `true`      |
| Edit history       | `undo`, `redo`                                                                                      |
| Durable plans      | `interview`, `resume-plan` (`rp`), `update-plan` (`up`), `plan-status` (`ps`), `lessons` (`lesson`), `plans` (`plan-ls`), `plan-use` (`plan-active`, `use-plan`) |
| Code review        | `review`                                                                                            |
| Conversation       | `new` (`n`, `clear`, `c`, `reset`, implicit), `history` (`chats`), `prompts` (`prompt-search`)      |
| Agent shortcuts    | `agent:general` (inserts `@general-agent `)                                                         |
| Feedback / misc    | `feedback`, `bash` (`!`), `diff`, `changes`, `image` (`img`, `attach`)                              |
| Mode switching     | `mode:<mode>` for every mode in `AGENT_MODES`, each with a `model:<mode>` alias                     |
| Theme / session    | `theme:toggle`, `exit` (`quit`, `q`, implicit)                                                      |

Starting a new durable plan is done by switching to plan MODE via
`mode:plan` (documented in the Mode switching row below); the standalone
`/plan` slash command has been removed because plan MODE already covers
that entry path and produces structured plan artifacts. The durable-plan
quartet (`/resume-plan`, `/update-plan`, `/plan-status`, `/lessons`) is
backed by the `update_plan_status` and `create_plan` tools documented
above and is the user-facing surface to the PlanLink artifact flow.
`/resume-plan`, `/update-plan`, `/plan-status`, and `/lessons` accept a
session target (slug or `.agents/sessions/<slug>` path) plus an optional
trailing note via `splitPlanCommandArgs`. With no target, they open the
plan-session picker instead of sending a prompt.

`review` uses a model-agnostic description ("with the configured
reviewer"); it never claims a specific hosted model.

### Skill commands

`getSlashCommandsWithSkills` appends one entry per discovered skill
(loaded from `.agents/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, or
`{cwd}/.claude/skills/`). Each skill command has id `skill:<name>`,
label `skill:<name>`, and a description derived from the skill's
frontmatter.

Gotcha: skill descriptions are truncated for the palette. Descriptions
longer than 50 characters are shortened to 49 characters plus a trailing
`…`. Descriptions of exactly 50 characters are left unchanged; this is a
strict greater-than comparison, not a `>=` boundary.

### Game-dev preset commands

When `getSlashCommandsWithSkills` is called with a `fileTree` argument, it
runs `detectEngineProfiles(fileTree)` (from
`common/src/util/engine-profiles.ts`, documented in the Shared Prompt
Sections above) and appends 4 task-preset slash commands per detected
engine: `<engine>:build`, `<engine>:run`, `<engine>:test`,
`<engine>:watch`. No game engine detected → no game-dev commands.

The presets live in `common/src/util/game-dev-presets.ts`. Public API:

- `getGameDevPresets(engineIds): GameDevPreset[]` — 4 presets per engine,
  ordered `build`, `run`, `test`, `watch`, in stable engine order
  (`unity`, `godot`, `unreal`, `bevy`).
- `getGameDevSlashCommands(engineIds)` — convenience wrapper returning the
  same presets in slash-command shape (`id`, `label`, `description`,
  `insertText`).
- `GameDevPreset` (type) — `{ id, label, description, insertText }`.

Each preset carries an `insertText` — a natural-language prompt (NOT a raw
shell command) that the agent receives and acts on by inspecting the
project to find the correct build system and commands. Selecting the
command inserts the prompt into the input field for review before sending.
This avoids hardcoding commands that may not match the project's actual
setup.

| Engine | Commands                                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unity  | `unity:build`, `unity:run`, `unity:test`, `unity:watch`     |
| Godot  | `godot:build`, `godot:run`, `godot:test`, `godot:watch`     |
| Unreal | `unreal:build`, `unreal:run`, `unreal:test`, `unreal:watch` |
| Bevy   | `bevy:build`, `bevy:run`, `bevy:test`, `bevy:watch`         |

The same module exports `getGameDevJobGuidance(engineIds)`, which returns
`GameDevJobGuidance[]` — engine-specific readiness patterns, error
patterns, log file paths, and stop instructions for managing long-running
editor/build/watch/export processes with `check_job` / `kill_job` /
`read_logs`. This is consumed by the agent at runtime when a game-dev
preset command spawns a background build or editor process.

Gotcha: game-dev command descriptions undergo the same ≤50-char
`truncateDescription` as skill commands.

### Aliases vs. implicit commands

`aliases` and `implicitCommand` are independent: a command may have
aliases that resolve inside the registry without being reachable
slashless, and an implicit command's aliases are never themselves
implicit. `SLASHLESS_COMMAND_IDS` is built from the lowercased `id` of
every `implicitCommand: true` entry only.
