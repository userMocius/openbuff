/**
 * Thin adapter that runs background agent turns on the unified job-registry
 * core (`@codebuff/common/util/job-registry`).
 *
 * A "background agent turn" is a {@link loopAgentSteps} invocation launched
 * detached from the main run via `spawn_agents({ background: true })`. The
 * parent's `handleSpawnAgents` returns immediately with a `jobId`; the agent
 * step loop runs as an un-awaited same-process coroutine whose progress the
 * parent (or another agent) can poll via `check_background_agent`.
 *
 * The unified core is the single source of truth for each job's lifecycle
 * state machine, its bounded sequenced event log (the chunk stream), and
 * ownership enforcement. This module is only an adapter on top of it:
 *
 * - It keeps a legacy live {@link BackgroundAgentJob} view per job — the
 *   object spawn_agents / check_background_agent hold across polls, with the
 *   historical fields (`chunks`, `readOffset`, `droppedChunks`, ...).
 * - It owns the coroutine AbortController (the core deliberately has no
 *   execution machinery) and enforces the background-agent capacity limits.
 * - It maps each streamed chunk onto a core `agent_chunk` event and folds
 *   coroutine settle/cancel into core `lifecycle` events.
 *
 * Preserved bounds: 200 buffered events per job (each chunk payload truncated
 * to 64KB), a 30-minute settled-job TTL, 100 retained adapter views, 32 running
 * background agents, 8 running background agents per root run. Every one of
 * those bounds is computed over the registry's 'agent'-kind population only (or,
 * for the view cap, over this adapter's own views), so shell `process` jobs
 * sharing the same registry never consume the background-AGENT budget and never
 * distort the view cap. This adapter shares the process-wide
 * `jobRegistry` singleton — the single source of truth every consumer
 * reads — and the core enforces the agent bounds (the 200-event ring buffer
 * and 30-minute settled TTL) per-kind for 'agent' jobs; the state machine,
 * sequenced event log, cursor math, and ownership checks are all the core's.
 * There is no disk recovery: background agents are process-scoped and never
 * outlive the CLI process.
