   - Goal:
   - Decisions:
   - Files Inspected:
   - Edits Made:
   - Validation Results:
   - Blockers:

User has typed "export". Export the current conversation. (It's ok to proceed even if in "Ask" mode because of user change to "Export" mode).

1. Summarize the entire conversation up to this point from the message history (excluding this 'export' command) into a new file.
2. The summary MUST be in Markdown format.
3. The summary MUST include:
   - All key decisions made during the conversation.
   - All significant file changes. If you have access to write_file blocks from our history, reproduce their paths and content accurately. If you only have diffs or descriptions of changes, summarize those.
   - The reasoning behind those decisions and changes.
4. Use the 'write_file' tool to save this Markdown summary to a new file with a generated name starting with the prefix 'codebuff-export-' like 'codebuff-export-topic-of-conversation.md' in the project root directory.

Write file tool format:

1. Ensure there is a \`knowledge.md\` file in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.

   - What this project is and where key code lives
   - Commands to run (install/dev/test/lint/build) based on package/tooling files
   - Notable conventions, constraints, and "gotchas"
3. Prefer reading existing docs (e.g. README, package.json, scripts) before writing.
4. Use the \`write_file\` tool to create/update \`knowledge.md\`. Do not mention any deprecated configuration files.
