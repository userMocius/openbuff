/**
 * P2-1: Deterministic judge signals.
 *
 * The LLM judge is subjective and high-variance. When an eval configures
 * `finalCheckCommands` (e.g. `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, `bun run lint`),
 * the agent-runner already captures their exit codes as `FinalCheckOutput[]`.
 * This module derives deterministic pass/fail signals from those exit codes and
 * uses them to clamp the LLM judge's scores — so a compile failure can never
 * yield a 7/10, regardless of how lenient the LLM judge feels.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Pure functions, no I/O, no side effects → trivially unit-testable.
 * - Clamping only ever *reduces* scores, never inflates them. The LLM judge
 *   remains the authority on subjective dimensions; deterministic signals only
 *   enforce hard upper bounds when the build/tests/lint are broken.
 * - Classification of a command as compile/test/lint is heuristic (boundary-
 *   aware token matching) and intentionally conservative: an unrecognized command is treated
 *   as a generic check that still contributes to the overall fail count, but
 *   does not trigger a category-specific clamp.
