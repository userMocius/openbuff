# Openbuff

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**Openbuff** is an open-source, local-first agentic coding CLI that edits your codebase through natural language instructions using your configured OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible providers. It is focused entirely on local/BYOK operation with no backend fallback, credits, or Openbuff subscription.

Instead of using one model for everything, Openbuff coordinates specialized agents that work together to understand your project and make precise changes.

> **Compatibility note:** Openbuff keeps selected upstream compatibility aliases so existing projects keep working. The SDK is published as `@openbuff/sdk`; `OpenbuffClient` is the primary export and `CodebuffClient` remains available as a compatibility alias. `CODEBUFF_API_KEY` is accepted as a fallback for `OPENBUFF_API_KEY`. Other legacy `CODEBUFF_*` environment variables and `codebuff.json` config paths were removed in the BYOK purge and are not supported. New docs and examples should use the Openbuff brand and primary `openbuff` / `OPENBUFF_*` / `openbuff.json` names unless they are documenting those compatibility aliases. See [Openbuff Local/BYOK Provider Mode](./docs/local-mode.md) for provider setup.

## How it works

When you ask Openbuff to "add authentication to my API," it might invoke:

1. A **File Picker Agent** to scan your codebase to understand the architecture and find relevant files
2. A **Planner Agent** to plan which files need changes and in what order
3. An **Editor Agent** to make precise edits
4. A **Reviewer Agent** to validate changes

This multi-agent approach gives you better context understanding, more accurate edits, and fewer errors compared to single-model tools.

## CLI: Install and start coding

Install:

```bash
npm install -g @openbuff/cli
```

Run:

```bash
cd your-project
openbuff
```

Configure a provider: inside the TUI run `/setup <preset>` (e.g. `/setup openai`) for a quick preset, or declare providers and model routing in `openbuff.json`. Then export the API key env var named by your provider's `apiKeyEnv` (e.g. `export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."`) and tell Openbuff what you want.

The full walkthrough — install → provider config → model routing → verification — is in [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md).

## Create custom agents

To get started building your own agents, start Openbuff and run the `/init` command:

```bash
openbuff
```

Then inside the CLI:

```
/init
```

This creates:

```
knowledge.md               # Project context for Openbuff
.agents/
└── types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
    ├── agent-definition.ts
    ├── tools.ts
    └── util-types.ts
```

You can write agent definition files that give you maximum control over agent behavior.

Implement your workflows by specifying tools, which agents can be spawned, and prompts. We even have TypeScript generators for more programmatic control.

For example, here's a `git-committer` agent that creates git commits based on the current git state. Notice that it runs `git diff` and `git log` to analyze changes, but then hands control over to the LLM to craft a meaningful commit message and perform the actual commit.

```typescript
export default {
  id: 'git-committer',
  displayName: 'Git Committer',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.4-nano',
  toolNames: ['read_files', 'run_terminal_command', 'end_turn'],

  instructionsPrompt:
    'You create meaningful git commits by analyzing changes, reading relevant files for context, and crafting clear commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes.',

  async *handleSteps() {
    // Analyze what changed
    yield { tool: 'run_terminal_command', command: 'git diff' }
    yield { tool: 'run_terminal_command', command: 'git log --oneline -5' }

    // Stage files and create commit with good message
    yield 'STEP_ALL'
  },
}
```

## SDK: Run agents in production

Install the [SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openbuff/sdk). The npm package name is `@openbuff/sdk`; it is the current Openbuff SDK package.

```bash
npm install @openbuff/sdk
```

Import the client and run agents!

```typescript
import { OpenbuffClient } from '@openbuff/sdk'

// 1. Initialize the client
const client = new OpenbuffClient({
  cwd: '/path/to/your/project',
  onError: (error) => console.error('Openbuff error:', error.message),
})

// 2. Do a coding task...
const result = await client.run({
  agent: 'base', // Openbuff's base coding agent
  prompt: 'Add error handling to all API endpoints',
  handleEvent: (event) => {
    console.log('Progress', event)
  },
})

// 3. Or, run a custom agent!
const myCustomAgent: AgentDefinition = {
  id: 'greeter',
  displayName: 'Greeter',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.5',
  instructionsPrompt: 'Say hello!',
}
await client.run({
  agent: 'greeter',
  agentDefinitions: [myCustomAgent],
  prompt: 'My name is Bob.',
  customToolDefinitions: [], // Add custom tools too!
  handleEvent: (event) => {
    console.log('Progress', event)
  },
})
```

## Provider configuration

New to Openbuff? [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) walks through the full setup path: install, configure a provider, route models, verify.

Openbuff runs local/BYOK by default: no hosted auth, credits, or platform
inference. Configure OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible providers and
per-agent model routing in `openbuff.json`. See [Openbuff Local/BYOK Provider Mode](./docs/local-mode.md).

Inside the CLI:

```text
/setup opencode-go   # or openai, anthropic, codex, openrouter, ollama, glm
/provider           # open the interactive provider picker
/provider add        # interactive provider wizard, including custom providers
/provider status     # show loaded config, provider URLs, missing env vars
/provider connect codex
/models             # open the model routing picker
/models configure   # interactive model routing wizard
/models set editor-proposal 2 opencode-go/glm-5.1
```

From the shell:

```bash
export OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY="your_key"
bun run smoke:openbuff
```

## Why choose Openbuff

**Custom workflows**: TypeScript generators let you mix AI generation with programmatic control. Agents can spawn subagents, branch on conditions, and run multi-step processes.

**Provider-flexible**: Unlike single-provider tools, Openbuff can route each agent to any configured provider: OpenAI API, Anthropic/Claude API, ChatGPT/Codex subscription OAuth, OpenRouter, opencode gateways, GLM/Z.ai, local Ollama/LM Studio, or another OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible endpoint.

**Reuse local agents**: Compose bundled and project-local `.agents/` without depending on a hosted registry.

**SDK**: Build Openbuff into your applications. Create custom tools, integrate with CI/CD, or embed coding assistance into your products.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Workflows

Create your own agents with specialized workflows using the `/init` command:

```bash
openbuff
/init
```

This creates a custom agent structure in `.agents/` that you can customize.
